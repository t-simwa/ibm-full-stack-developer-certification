PART 1: UNDERSTANDING EXPRESSIONS
================================================================================

SECTION 1.1: WHAT ARE EXPRESSIONS?
-----------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Expressions describe a type of operation the computers perform. Expressions are 
operations the Python performs.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls 
that Python evaluates to produce a result. Think of an expression as a question 
you're asking Python, and Python responds with an answer (the result).

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of expressions like mathematical equations:
• In math class: "What is 5 + 3?" → Answer: 8
• In Python: 5 + 3 → Result: 8

Expressions are like instructions you give to Python:
• "Add these numbers together"
• "Multiply these values"
• "Divide this by that"

WHAT PYTHON DOES WITH EXPRESSIONS
----------------------------------
When Python encounters an expression, it:
1. Reads the expression from left to right
2. Identifies the operators and operands
3. Follows mathematical rules (order of operations)
4. Performs the calculations
5. Returns a single result value

EXAMPLE: BASIC EXPRESSION
-------------------------
Here's a simple expression:

  5 + 3

WHAT HAPPENS:
• Python sees the number 5
• Python sees the + operator (addition)
• Python sees the number 3
• Python performs: 5 + 3
• Python returns: 8

THE RESULT
----------
Every expression evaluates to a single value. This value can be:
• A number (like 8, 3.14, -5)
• A string (like "hello")
• A boolean (True or False)
• Other data types we'll learn about later

WHY EXPRESSIONS MATTER
----------------------
Expressions are fundamental because:
• They allow you to perform calculations
• They enable data manipulation
• They form the building blocks of more complex programs
• They let you transform input into output
• They make programs dynamic and useful

[END SECTION 1.1]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.2: OPERATORS AND OPERANDS
------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
In any expression, we have two main components:
• OPERANDS: The values or variables that the operation is performed on
• OPERATORS: The symbols that represent the operation to be performed

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Think of operators as verbs (actions) and operands as nouns (things being acted upon).

EXAMPLE: ADDITION EXPRESSION
-----------------------------
Let's look at a basic addition expression:

  100 + 60

BREAKDOWN:
• 100 → This is an OPERAND (a number)
• + → This is an OPERATOR (the addition symbol)
• 60 → This is an OPERAND (another number)

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
• Python takes the first operand: 100
• Python sees the operator: + (addition)
• Python takes the second operand: 60
• Python performs: 100 + 60
• Python returns: 160

THE RESULT: 160

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
Here's how to visualize an expression:

  [Operand] [Operator] [Operand] = [Result]
     100         +         60        160

MORE COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS
------------------------
Expressions can have multiple operators and operands:

  10 + 20 + 30

BREAKDOWN:
• Operands: 10, 20, 30
• Operators: +, +
• Result: 60

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
• First: 10 + 20 = 30
• Then: 30 + 30 = 60
• Final result: 60

TYPES OF OPERATORS
------------------
Python has many types of operators:
• Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
• Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
• Logical operators: and, or, not
• Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
• And many more...

In this guide, we'll focus on arithmetic operators, which are the most fundamental.

[END SECTION 1.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.3: BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
-----------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
Python can perform all the basic arithmetic operations you learned in math class:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation uses a 
specific operator symbol.

OPERATION 1: ADDITION
---------------------
DEFINITION:
Addition combines two or more numbers to get their sum.

OPERATOR: + (plus sign)

EXAMPLE 1: SIMPLE ADDITION
--------------------------
  100 + 60

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a single-line expression:
• 100 → First operand (the number one hundred)
• + → Addition operator (tells Python to add)
• 60 → Second operand (the number sixty)
• Python evaluates: 100 + 60
• Result: 160

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 100
2. Python reads: + (recognizes this as addition)
3. Python reads: 60
4. Python calculates: 100 + 60
5. Python returns: 160

EXAMPLE 2: MULTIPLE ADDITIONS
------------------------------
  10 + 20 + 30 + 40

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This expression has multiple additions:
• 10 → First operand
• + → First addition operator
• 20 → Second operand
• + → Second addition operator
• 30 → Third operand
• + → Third addition operator
• 40 → Fourth operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. First addition: 10 + 20 = 30
2. Second addition: 30 + 30 = 60
3. Third addition: 60 + 40 = 100
4. Final result: 100

OPERATION 2: SUBTRACTION
-------------------------
DEFINITION:
Subtraction finds the difference between two numbers.

OPERATOR: - (minus sign or hyphen)

EXAMPLE: SUBTRACTION
---------------------
  5 - 10

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a subtraction expression:
• 5 → First operand (the number five)
• - → Subtraction operator (tells Python to subtract)
• 10 → Second operand (the number ten)
• Python evaluates: 5 - 10
• Result: -5 (negative five)

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 5
2. Python reads: - (recognizes this as subtraction)
3. Python reads: 10
4. Python calculates: 5 - 10
5. Python returns: -5

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT NEGATIVE NUMBERS
--------------------------------------
When the result of subtraction is negative, Python returns a negative number. 
This is mathematically correct:
• If you have 5 and subtract 10, you get -5
• Negative numbers are valid results in Python
• Python handles negative numbers just like positive numbers

MORE SUBTRACTION EXAMPLES
--------------------------
Example 1: Positive result
  10 - 5
  Result: 5

Example 2: Negative result
  5 - 10
  Result: -5

Example 3: Multiple subtractions
  100 - 20 - 10
  Step 1: 100 - 20 = 80
  Step 2: 80 - 10 = 70
  Result: 70

OPERATION 3: MULTIPLICATION
----------------------------
DEFINITION:
Multiplication combines numbers to get their product.

OPERATOR: * (asterisk)

IMPORTANT: In Python, you cannot use × or · for multiplication. You MUST use the 
asterisk (*) symbol.

EXAMPLE: MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------
  5 * 5

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a multiplication expression:
• 5 → First operand (the number five)
• * → Multiplication operator (asterisk symbol)
• 5 → Second operand (the number five)
• Python evaluates: 5 * 5
• Result: 25

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 5
2. Python reads: * (recognizes this as multiplication)
3. Python reads: 5
4. Python calculates: 5 × 5 (in mathematical notation)
5. Python returns: 25

WHY ASTERISK FOR MULTIPLICATION?
---------------------------------
• The × symbol is not on standard keyboards
• The asterisk (*) is easily accessible
• It's a programming convention used across many languages
• It's clear and unambiguous

MORE MULTIPLICATION EXAMPLES
-----------------------------
Example 1: Simple multiplication
  3 * 4
  Result: 12

Example 2: Multiple multiplications
  2 * 3 * 4
  Step 1: 2 * 3 = 6
  Step 2: 6 * 4 = 24
  Result: 24

Example 3: Multiplying by zero
  10 * 0
  Result: 0

Example 4: Multiplying negative numbers
  -5 * 3
  Result: -15

  -5 * -3
  Result: 15 (negative times negative equals positive)

OPERATION 4: DIVISION
---------------------
DEFINITION:
Division splits a number into equal parts or finds how many times one number 
fits into another.

OPERATOR: / (forward slash)

EXAMPLE 1: EXACT DIVISION
--------------------------
  25 / 5

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a division expression:
• 25 → First operand (the dividend - number being divided)
• / → Division operator (forward slash)
• 5 → Second operand (the divisor - number dividing by)
• Python evaluates: 25 / 5
• Result: 5.0

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 25
2. Python reads: / (recognizes this as division)
3. Python reads: 5
4. Python calculates: 25 ÷ 5 (in mathematical notation)
5. Python returns: 5.0

IMPORTANT: FLOATING POINT RESULT
---------------------------------
Notice that the result is 5.0, not 5. In Python 3 (the version we're using), 
division ALWAYS returns a float (floating-point number), even when the result 
is a whole number.

EXAMPLE 2: DIVISION WITH DECIMAL RESULT
----------------------------------------
  25 / 6

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This division doesn't result in a whole number:
• 25 → Dividend
• / → Division operator
• 6 → Divisor
• Python evaluates: 25 / 6
• Result: 4.166666666666667 (approximately 4.167)

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 25
2. Python reads: / (division)
3. Python reads: 6
4. Python calculates: 25 ÷ 6
5. Python returns: 4.166666666666667

PYTHON 3 DIVISION BEHAVIOR
---------------------------
In Python 3, the version we will be using in this course, both will result in 
a float. This means:
• 25 / 5 → Result: 5.0 (float, not integer)
• 25 / 6 → Result: 4.166666666666667 (float)

WHY ALWAYS FLOAT?
-----------------
Python 3 always returns floats from division because:
• It's more mathematically accurate
• It prevents unexpected integer truncation
• It's consistent - you always know what type you'll get
• It matches mathematical expectations

COMPARISON WITH PYTHON 2
------------------------
In Python 2 (older version):
• 25 / 5 → Result: 5 (integer)
• 25 / 6 → Result: 4 (integer, truncated!)

Python 3 is better because it doesn't truncate results unexpectedly.

MORE DIVISION EXAMPLES
-----------------------
Example 1: Even division
  10 / 2
  Result: 5.0

Example 2: Decimal result
  7 / 2
  Result: 3.5

Example 3: Division by 1
  100 / 1
  Result: 100.0

Example 4: Small number divided by large number
  1 / 4
  Result: 0.25

[END SECTION 1.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.4: DIVISION IN PYTHON
--------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
Python provides two types of division:
1. Regular division (/) - Always returns a float
2. Integer division (//) - Returns an integer (rounded down)

We already covered regular division. Now let's learn about integer division.

INTEGER DIVISION
----------------
DEFINITION:
Integer division divides two numbers and returns the result rounded down to the 
nearest integer (whole number).

OPERATOR: // (double forward slash)

EXAMPLE: INTEGER DIVISION
--------------------------
  25 // 6

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is an integer division expression:
• 25 → Dividend
• // → Integer division operator (double forward slash)
• 6 → Divisor
• Python evaluates: 25 // 6
• Result: 4 (integer, not float)

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Python reads: 25
2. Python reads: // (recognizes this as integer division)
3. Python reads: 6
4. Python calculates: 25 ÷ 6 = 4.1666...
5. Python rounds DOWN to nearest integer: 4
6. Python returns: 4 (as an integer)

HOW INTEGER DIVISION WORKS
--------------------------
Integer division performs division but then:
• Takes the result
• Rounds it DOWN to the nearest whole number
• Returns an integer (not a float)

This is also called "floor division" because it always rounds down (toward 
negative infinity).

COMPARISON: REGULAR VS INTEGER DIVISION
---------------------------------------
Let's compare the two types of division:

Example 1: 25 / 6 vs 25 // 6
  Regular division: 25 / 6
    Result: 4.166666666666667 (float, precise)
  
  Integer division: 25 // 6
    Result: 4 (integer, rounded down)

Example 2: 25 / 5 vs 25 // 5
  Regular division: 25 / 5
    Result: 5.0 (float, even though it's a whole number)
  
  Integer division: 25 // 5
    Result: 5 (integer, same value but different type)

Example 3: 10 / 3 vs 10 // 3
  Regular division: 10 / 3
    Result: 3.3333333333333335 (float)
  
  Integer division: 10 // 3
    Result: 3 (integer, rounded down from 3.333...)

IMPORTANT WARNING
-----------------
Be aware, in some cases, the results are not the same as regular division. This 
is intentional and important to understand:

WHEN RESULTS DIFFER:
• Regular division: 25 / 6 = 4.1666... (precise decimal)
• Integer division: 25 // 6 = 4 (rounded down integer)

WHEN RESULTS ARE SIMILAR (but types differ):
• Regular division: 25 / 5 = 5.0 (float)
• Integer division: 25 // 5 = 5 (integer)

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE
---------------------
Use regular division (/) when:
• You need precise decimal results
• You're doing mathematical calculations
• You need accuracy for measurements
• You're working with percentages

Use integer division (//) when:
• You need whole numbers only
• You're counting items (can't have half an item)
• You're working with indices or positions
• You want to round down intentionally

MORE INTEGER DIVISION EXAMPLES
-------------------------------
Example 1: Even division
  20 // 4
  Result: 5

Example 2: Rounding down
  19 // 4
  Result: 4 (not 4.75)

Example 3: With negative numbers
  -19 // 4
  Result: -5 (rounds down toward negative infinity)

Example 4: Large numbers
  1000 // 3
  Result: 333 (not 333.333...)

[END SECTION 1.4]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.5: ORDER OF OPERATIONS
---------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions. 
This means Python uses the same rules you learned in math class for determining 
which operations to perform first.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
What happens when you have multiple operations in one expression? For example:

  2 + 3 * 4

Should Python:
• Add first: (2 + 3) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20
• Multiply first: 2 + (3 * 4) = 2 + 12 = 14

The answer depends on the order of operations!

MATHEMATICAL CONVENTIONS (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
-----------------------------------------
Python follows the standard mathematical order of operations, often remembered 
by the acronym PEMDAS or BODMAS:

PEMDAS:
• P - Parentheses (do these first)
• E - Exponents (powers)
• M - Multiplication
• D - Division
• A - Addition
• S - Subtraction

BODMAS:
• B - Brackets (parentheses)
• O - Orders (exponents/powers)
• D - Division
• M - Multiplication
• A - Addition
• S - Subtraction

MULTIPLICATION BEFORE ADDITION
-------------------------------
The following operations are in a different order. In both cases, Python performs 
multiplication, then addition to obtain the final result.

EXAMPLE 1: MULTIPLICATION BEFORE ADDITION
------------------------------------------
  2 + 3 * 4

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This expression has both addition and multiplication:
• 2 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 3 → Second operand
• * → Multiplication operator
• 4 → Third operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees the expression: 2 + 3 * 4
2. Python checks order of operations
3. Multiplication comes before addition (M before A in PEMDAS)
4. Python performs multiplication first: 3 * 4 = 12
5. Python replaces 3 * 4 with 12: 2 + 12
6. Python performs addition: 2 + 12 = 14
7. Final result: 14

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: 2 + 3 * 4
  Step 1:   2 + 12      (multiply 3 * 4)
  Step 2:   14           (add 2 + 12)

EXAMPLE 2: SAME OPERATIONS, DIFFERENT ORDER
--------------------------------------------
  3 * 4 + 2

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
Even though the numbers are in a different order:
• 3 → First operand
• * → Multiplication operator
• 4 → Second operand
• + → Addition operator
• 2 → Third operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: 3 * 4 + 2
2. Multiplication comes before addition
3. Python performs multiplication first: 3 * 4 = 12
4. Python replaces 3 * 4 with 12: 12 + 2
5. Python performs addition: 12 + 2 = 14
6. Final result: 14

IMPORTANT POINT
---------------
In both cases, Python performs multiplication, then addition to obtain the final 
result. The order of operations doesn't depend on the left-to-right order of 
the operators in the expression - it depends on the mathematical precedence 
of the operations themselves.

MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
----------------------------
Multiplication and division have the SAME precedence. When both appear, Python 
evaluates them from left to right.

EXAMPLE: MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
-------------------------------------
  10 * 2 / 5

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This has both multiplication and division:
• 10 → First operand
• * → Multiplication operator
• 2 → Second operand
• / → Division operator
• 5 → Third operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: 10 * 2 / 5
2. Multiplication and division have same precedence
3. Python evaluates left to right
4. First: 10 * 2 = 20
5. Then: 20 / 5 = 4.0
6. Final result: 4.0

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: 10 * 2 / 5
  Step 1:   20 / 5      (multiply 10 * 2)
  Step 2:   4.0          (divide 20 / 5)

ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
-------------------------
Addition and subtraction also have the SAME precedence. When both appear, Python 
evaluates them from left to right.

EXAMPLE: ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
----------------------------------
  10 + 5 - 3

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This has both addition and subtraction:
• 10 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 5 → Second operand
• - → Subtraction operator
• 3 → Third operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: 10 + 5 - 3
2. Addition and subtraction have same precedence
3. Python evaluates left to right
4. First: 10 + 5 = 15
5. Then: 15 - 3 = 12
6. Final result: 12

COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS
-------------------
When you have multiple operations of different precedence levels, Python follows 
the order strictly.

EXAMPLE: COMPLEX EXPRESSION
----------------------------
  2 + 3 * 4 - 1

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This has addition, multiplication, and subtraction:
• 2 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 3 → Second operand
• * → Multiplication operator
• 4 → Third operand
• - → Subtraction operator
• 1 → Fourth operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: 2 + 3 * 4 - 1
2. Order of operations: multiplication first, then addition/subtraction
3. First: 3 * 4 = 12
4. Expression becomes: 2 + 12 - 1
5. Then left to right: 2 + 12 = 14
6. Then: 14 - 1 = 13
7. Final result: 13

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: 2 + 3 * 4 - 1
  Step 1:   2 + 12 - 1    (multiply 3 * 4)
  Step 2:   14 - 1        (add 2 + 12)
  Step 3:   13             (subtract 14 - 1)

SUMMARY OF ORDER OF OPERATIONS
-------------------------------
1. Parentheses (highest priority - do these first)
2. Exponents/Powers
3. Multiplication and Division (same level, left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (same level, left to right)

[END SECTION 1.5]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.6: USING PARENTHESES
-------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
The expressions in the parentheses are performed first. Parentheses allow you to 
override the default order of operations and control exactly which operations 
Python performs first.

WHY PARENTHESES MATTER
----------------------
Parentheses give you control over the order of operations. They tell Python: 
"Perform the operations inside these parentheses FIRST, before doing anything else."

EXAMPLE: PARENTHESES OVERRIDE ORDER
------------------------------------
Let's compare expressions with and without parentheses:

WITHOUT PARENTHESES:
  2 + 3 * 4
  Result: 14 (multiplication happens first)

WITH PARENTHESES:
  (2 + 3) * 4
  Result: 20 (addition happens first because of parentheses)

DETAILED EXAMPLE
-----------------
  (2 + 3) * 4

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This expression uses parentheses to change the order:
• ( → Opening parenthesis (tells Python to group operations)
• 2 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 3 → Second operand
• ) → Closing parenthesis (ends the grouping)
• * → Multiplication operator
• 4 → Third operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: (2 + 3) * 4
2. Python recognizes parentheses - must evaluate inside first
3. Python performs addition inside parentheses: 2 + 3 = 5
4. Python replaces (2 + 3) with 5: 5 * 4
5. Python performs multiplication: 5 * 4 = 20
6. Final result: 20

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: (2 + 3) * 4
  Step 1:   5 * 4        (add 2 + 3 inside parentheses)
  Step 2:   20           (multiply 5 * 4)

COMPARISON: WITH VS WITHOUT PARENTHESES
---------------------------------------
Example 1: Without parentheses
  2 + 3 * 4
  Step 1: 2 + 12    (multiply 3 * 4 first)
  Step 2: 14        (then add)
  Result: 14

Example 2: With parentheses
  (2 + 3) * 4
  Step 1: 5 * 4     (add 2 + 3 first because of parentheses)
  Step 2: 20        (then multiply)
  Result: 20

NESTED PARENTHESES
------------------
You can use parentheses inside parentheses. Python evaluates the innermost 
parentheses first.

EXAMPLE: NESTED PARENTHESES
----------------------------
  ((2 + 3) * 4) + 1

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This has nested parentheses:
• ( → Outer opening parenthesis
• ( → Inner opening parenthesis
• 2 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 3 → Second operand
• ) → Inner closing parenthesis
• * → Multiplication operator
• 4 → Third operand
• ) → Outer closing parenthesis
• + → Addition operator
• 1 → Fourth operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: ((2 + 3) * 4) + 1
2. Innermost parentheses first: (2 + 3) = 5
3. Expression becomes: (5 * 4) + 1
4. Next parentheses: 5 * 4 = 20
5. Expression becomes: 20 + 1
6. Final addition: 20 + 1 = 21
7. Final result: 21

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: ((2 + 3) * 4) + 1
  Step 1:   (5 * 4) + 1       (innermost: 2 + 3)
  Step 2:   20 + 1             (next: 5 * 4)
  Step 3:   21                 (final: 20 + 1)

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE FROM THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL
---------------------------------------------
The expressions in the parentheses are performed first. We then multiply the 
result by 60. The result is 1920.

Let's break down what this means:

EXAMPLE: PARENTHESES THEN MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------
  (10 + 20 + 2) * 60

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This expression demonstrates the concept:
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 10 → First operand
• + → Addition operator
• 20 → Second operand
• + → Addition operator
• 2 → Third operand
• ) → Closing parenthesis
• * → Multiplication operator
• 60 → Fourth operand

WHAT PYTHON DOES:
1. Python sees: (10 + 20 + 2) * 60
2. Parentheses first: evaluate 10 + 20 + 2
3. Step 1 inside parentheses: 10 + 20 = 30
4. Step 2 inside parentheses: 30 + 2 = 32
5. Expression becomes: 32 * 60
6. Python multiplies: 32 * 60 = 1920
7. Final result: 1920

STEP-BY-STEP VISUALIZATION:
  Original: (10 + 20 + 2) * 60
  Step 1:   32 * 60            (add inside parentheses: 10 + 20 + 2)
  Step 2:   1920                (multiply: 32 * 60)

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
This example shows:
• The expressions in the parentheses are performed first (10 + 20 + 2 = 32)
• We then multiply the result by 60 (32 * 60)
• The result is 1920

This demonstrates that parentheses control the order of operations, ensuring 
the addition happens before the multiplication.

MORE PARENTHESES EXAMPLES
--------------------------
Example 1: Simple grouping
  (5 + 3) * 2
  Result: 16

Example 2: Multiple groups
  (10 - 2) * (3 + 1)
  Step 1: 8 * 4      (evaluate both parentheses)
  Step 2: 32
  Result: 32

Example 3: Nested parentheses
  ((10 / 2) + 3) * 4
  Step 1: (5 + 3) * 4    (divide 10 / 2)
  Step 2: 8 * 4          (add 5 + 3)
  Step 3: 32             (multiply)
  Result: 32

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
• Use parentheses to make your code more readable
• Use parentheses when the order might be unclear
• Use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations
• Don't be afraid to use parentheses even when they're not strictly necessary

SUMMARY OF PART 1
==================

KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
--------------------
1. EXPRESSIONS: Operations Python performs to produce results
2. OPERATORS: Symbols that represent operations (+, -, *, /, //)
3. OPERANDS: Values that operations are performed on
4. ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
5. DIVISION TYPES: Regular division (/) always returns float, integer division 
   (//) returns integer
6. ORDER OF OPERATIONS: Python follows mathematical conventions (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
7. PARENTHESES: Control the order of operations by grouping expressions

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
--------------------
• Expressions are the building blocks of Python programs
• Every expression evaluates to a single value
• Python follows standard mathematical order of operations
• Parentheses allow you to control evaluation order
• Division in Python 3 always returns floats (unless using //)
• Integer division rounds down to the nearest whole number

NEXT STEPS
----------
In Part 2, we'll learn about:
• Variables and how to store values
• Variable assignment and reassignment
• Storing expression results in variables
• Variable naming conventions
• The type() function
• Practical examples combining expressions and variables
