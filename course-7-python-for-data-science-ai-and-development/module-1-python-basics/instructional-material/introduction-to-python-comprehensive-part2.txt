        • Makes code easier to modify

Line 8: Configure pin
        • GPIO.setup(LED_PIN, GPIO.OUT) - Sets pin as output
        • GPIO.OUT means pin will send signals (not receive)
        • Prepares pin to control the LED

Line 10: (empty line)

Line 11: Start try block
        • try: - Starts error handling block
        • Code inside will run, errors will be caught

Line 12: Infinite loop
        • while True: - Loop that runs forever
        • Will continue until interrupted
        • Creates continuous blinking

Line 13: Turn LED on
        • GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.HIGH) - Sets pin to HIGH
        • GPIO.HIGH sends voltage to the pin
        • LED turns on when pin is HIGH

Line 14: Wait
        • time.sleep(1) - Pauses for 1 second
        • LED stays on during this time
        • 1 second delay

Line 15: Turn LED off
        • GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.LOW) - Sets pin to LOW
        • GPIO.LOW removes voltage from pin
        • LED turns off when pin is LOW

Line 16: Wait again
        • time.sleep(1) - Pauses for 1 second
        • LED stays off during this time
        • Creates blinking pattern

Line 17: Handle interruption
        • except KeyboardInterrupt: - Catches Ctrl+C
        • When user presses Ctrl+C, this runs
        • Allows clean exit from program

Line 18: Cleanup
        • GPIO.cleanup() - Resets GPIO pins
        • Important for proper shutdown
        • Prevents pin conflicts

This example shows how Python makes IoT programming accessible and straightforward.

PART 3: UNDERSTANDING PYTHON AS A LANGUAGE
================================================================================

SECTION 3.1: WHAT IS A HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE?
--------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Let's break down 
what "high-level" means.

WHAT IS A HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE?
-------------------------------
A high-level language is a programming language that:
• Is closer to human language than machine language
• Uses words and symbols that are easy to understand
• Hides low-level details from the programmer
• Provides abstractions that simplify programming
• Requires less knowledge of computer hardware

LEVELS OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
--------------------------------
Programming languages exist on a spectrum:

1. LOW-LEVEL LANGUAGES
   • Machine code (0s and 1s)
   • Assembly language
   • Close to hardware
   • Hard to read and write
   • Very fast execution

2. MID-LEVEL LANGUAGES
   • C, C++
   • Some abstraction
   • Still close to hardware
   • More control over hardware
   • Moderate difficulty

3. HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES
   • Python, Java, JavaScript
   • Far from hardware
   • Easy to read and write
   • Many abstractions
   • Slower than low-level (but usually fast enough)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of programming languages like transportation:

LOW-LEVEL = WALKING
• Direct control (every step)
• Very efficient
• Requires physical effort
• Close to the ground

MID-LEVEL = BICYCLING
• Some abstraction (wheels help)
• Still requires effort
• More efficient than walking
• Some mechanical knowledge needed

HIGH-LEVEL = DRIVING A CAR
• High abstraction (steering wheel, pedals)
• Easy to use
• Don't need to understand engine
• Focus on destination, not mechanics

Python is like driving a car - you focus on where you want to go, not how the 
engine works.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES
---------------------------------------
High-level languages like Python have:

1. READABLE SYNTAX
   • Code reads like English
   • Easy to understand
   • Self-documenting
   • Clear intent

2. AUTOMATIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT
   • Don't manually allocate memory
   • Garbage collection handles cleanup
   • Less memory-related errors
   • Easier programming

3. BUILT-IN DATA STRUCTURES
   • Lists, dictionaries, sets built-in
   • Don't need to implement from scratch
   • Optimized implementations
   • Easy to use

4. ABSTRACTION
   • Hide implementation details
   • Focus on what, not how
   • Higher-level operations
   • Simplified programming

5. PORTABILITY
   • Code runs on different platforms
   • Write once, run anywhere (mostly)
   • Platform-independent
   • Easier deployment

EXAMPLE: COMPARING LEVELS
--------------------------
Let's compare how different languages handle the same task:

TASK: Add two numbers and store result

MACHINE CODE (Lowest Level):
  10111000 00000001 00000000
  00000011 00000110
  10100011 00000000 00000000

ASSEMBLY (Low Level):
  MOV AX, 1
  ADD AX, 6
  MOV [result], AX

C (Mid Level):
  int a = 1;
  int b = 6;
  int result = a + b;

PYTHON (High Level):
  a = 1
  b = 6
  result = a + b

As you can see, Python is the most readable and closest to how humans think 
about the problem.

BENEFITS OF HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES
---------------------------------
1. EASIER TO LEARN
   • More intuitive
   • Closer to human thinking
