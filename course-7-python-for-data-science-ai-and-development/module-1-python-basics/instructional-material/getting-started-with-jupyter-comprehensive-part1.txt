where code is written in separate files and executed separately, Jupyter notebooks 
combine code, text, visualizations, and outputs in a single interactive document. 
This makes them perfect for data exploration, analysis, experimentation, and 
sharing results.

In the lab session of this module, you can launch a notebook using the Skills 
Network virtual environment. This environment provides you with a pre-configured 
Jupyter Lab setup that requires no installation on your local machine. You simply 
need to access it through your web browser, making it accessible from anywhere 
with an internet connection.

This guide will walk you through:
• Understanding Jupyter and its importance
• Accessing the Skills Network virtual environment
• Launching and navigating Jupyter Lab
• Basic notebook operations (running, inserting, deleting cells)
• Working with multiple notebooks
• Creating presentations
• Properly managing and shutting down sessions

PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO JUPYTER AND GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

SECTION 1.1: WHAT IS JUPYTER?
-------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share 
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. 
The name "Jupyter" is derived from the three core programming languages it 
originally supported: Julia, Python, and R (Ju-Pyt-e-R).

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Let's break down what Jupyter actually is and what makes it special:

WHAT IS A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK?
----------------------------
A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that combines:
• CODE: Executable code cells where you write and run code
• OUTPUT: Results that appear directly below code cells
• TEXT: Markdown cells for explanations, notes, and documentation
• VISUALIZATIONS: Charts, graphs, and plots embedded in the document
• EQUATIONS: Mathematical formulas rendered beautifully

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of a Jupyter notebook like a scientific lab notebook:
• A lab notebook contains experiments, observations, and results
• A Jupyter notebook contains code experiments, outputs, and explanations
• Both are interactive - you can add new entries and modify existing ones
• Both combine different types of information (text, data, visuals)
• Both are meant to be shared and understood by others

Or think of it like a combination of:
• A Word document (for text and formatting)
• A code editor (for writing code)
• A terminal/console (for running code)
• A presentation tool (for showing results)

All combined into one seamless interface!

THE JUPYTER ECOSYSTEM
---------------------
Jupyter consists of several components:

1. JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (Classic)
   • The original notebook interface
   • Simpler, more focused on individual notebooks
   • Good for beginners and simple projects

2. JUPYTER LAB (What we'll be using)
   • The next-generation interface
   • More powerful and feature-rich
   • Supports multiple notebooks, file browsers, terminals, and more
   • Better for complex projects and professional work

3. JUPYTERHUB
   • Multi-user version of Jupyter
   • Used by organizations and institutions
   • Allows multiple users to access notebooks on a server

4. JUPYTER KERNELS
   • The "engine" that executes your code
   • Different kernels support different languages
   • Python kernel executes Python code
   • R kernel executes R code
   • Julia kernel executes Julia code
   • And many more!

WHY IS IT CALLED "JUPYTER"?
---------------------------
The name comes from combining:
• Ju = Julia
• Py = Python
• Te = TeX (for mathematical notation)
• R = R

However, Jupyter now supports over 100 programming languages through its kernel 
system, not just these three!

KEY FEATURES OF JUPYTER
-----------------------
1. INTERACTIVE EXECUTION
   • Run code cell by cell
   • See results immediately
   • Modify and re-run easily
   • No need to run entire programs

================================================================================

SECTION 1.2: WHY JUPYTER FOR DATA SCIENCE?
-------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
Jupyter has become the de facto standard tool for data science work. Understanding 
why it's so popular and how it fits into the data science workflow will help you 
appreciate its value and use it more effectively.

THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW
-------------------------
Data science typically involves these steps:
1. DATA COLLECTION: Getting data from various sources
2. DATA CLEANING: Fixing errors, handling missing values
3. DATA EXPLORATION: Understanding what's in the data
4. DATA ANALYSIS: Finding patterns and insights
5. VISUALIZATION: Creating charts and graphs
6. MODELING: Building predictive models
7. COMMUNICATION: Sharing findings with others

Jupyter excels at every single one of these steps!

HOW JUPYTER SUPPORTS EACH STEP
-------------------------------

1. DATA COLLECTION
   • Write code to fetch data from APIs, databases, files
   • See what data you're getting immediately
   • Test different data sources in separate cells
   • Document where data came from in markdown cells

2. DATA CLEANING
   • Run cleaning operations step by step
   • See results after each cleaning step
   • Compare before and after easily
   • Document your cleaning decisions

3. DATA EXPLORATION
   • Run exploratory queries in separate cells
   • See results immediately
   • Try different questions without re-running everything
   • Keep all your explorations in one place

4. DATA ANALYSIS
   • Write analysis code incrementally
   • See intermediate results
   • Adjust analysis based on what you see
   • Build complex analyses step by step

5. VISUALIZATION
   • Create plots and charts inline
   • See visualizations immediately
   • Iterate on visualizations quickly
   • Keep visualizations with the code that created them

6. MODELING
   • Train models in cells
   • See training progress
   • Evaluate models and see metrics
   • Compare different models side by side

7. COMMUNICATION
   • Combine code, results, and explanations
   • Create professional reports
   • Share with non-technical stakeholders
   • Others can reproduce your work

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE: DATA SCIENCE PROJECT
-----------------------------------------
Imagine you're analyzing sales data:

TRADITIONAL APPROACH:
• Write Python script to load data
• Run script, check output file
• Write another script to clean data
• Run script, check output file
• Write script to analyze
• Run script, check output file
• Write script to visualize
• Run script, open image file
• Write report in Word
• Copy results into report
• Hope everything still works!

JUPYTER APPROACH:
• Load data in one cell → see data immediately
• Clean data in next cell → see cleaned data
• Analyze in next cell → see analysis results
• Visualize in next cell → see chart inline
• Add explanations in markdown cells
• Everything in one document!
• Share the notebook → others can run it themselves

THE ITERATIVE NATURE OF DATA SCIENCE
-------------------------------------
Data science is highly iterative:
• You explore data and find something interesting
• You dig deeper into that finding
• You realize you need to clean data differently
• You try a different analysis approach
• You create a visualization, then refine it
• You share results, get feedback, iterate again

Jupyter's cell-by-cell execution is perfect for this iterative process:
• Run only the cells you need to change
• Don't re-run everything from scratch
• See results immediately
• Adjust and iterate quickly

COLLABORATION IN DATA SCIENCE
------------------------------
Data science is often collaborative:
• Data scientists work with domain experts
• Results need to be shared with stakeholders
• Teams need to review and reproduce analyses
• Managers need to understand findings

Jupyter facilitates collaboration:
• Share notebooks easily
• Others can see your code and results
• Others can run your code themselves
• Non-technical people can read markdown explanations
• Technical people can examine code

REPRODUCIBILITY IN DATA SCIENCE
--------------------------------
Reproducibility is crucial in data science:
• Others should be able to reproduce your results
• You should be able to reproduce your own work later
• Results should be verifiable
• Analyses should be transparent

Jupyter helps with reproducibility:
• Code and results are together
• Clear execution order
• Can see what code produced what results
• Others can run the same code
• Version control possible (though requires care)

LEARNING AND TEACHING
---------------------
Jupyter is excellent for learning:
• See code and results together
• Experiment without fear
• Learn by doing
• Try different approaches easily

Jupyter is excellent for teaching:
• Show code and results together

UNDERSTANDING KERNELS
---------------------
The kernel is the "engine" that runs your code:

WHAT IS A KERNEL?
• Executes code in cells
• Maintains state between cells
• Variables persist across cells
• Can be interrupted or restarted

KERNEL INDICATORS:
• Top right of notebook shows kernel status
• Green circle = kernel ready
• Gray circle = kernel busy
• Red circle = kernel error
• "Python 3" = kernel type

KERNEL ACTIONS:
• Interrupt: Stop running code
• Restart: Clear memory, start fresh
• Reconnect: Fix connection issues
• Shutdown: Stop kernel completely

WHY KERNELS MATTER:
• Variables persist: x = 5 in one cell, use x in another
• Import once: import pandas in one cell, use everywhere
• State matters: Order of execution affects results
• Restart clears: Restarting kernel clears all variables

UNDERSTANDING CELL EXECUTION
-----------------------------
When you run a cell:

1. CODE IS SENT TO KERNEL
   • Your code goes to the Python kernel
   • Kernel executes the code
   • This happens on the server (not your computer)

2. OUTPUT IS RETURNED
   • Results come back from kernel
   • Displayed below the cell
   • Can be text, numbers, plots, errors

3. EXECUTION NUMBER UPDATED
   • Cell shows [1], [2], [3], etc.
   • Shows order of execution
   • Helps track what ran when

4. STATE IS UPDATED
   • Variables are stored in kernel
   • Can be used in later cells
   • State persists until kernel restarts

EXECUTION ORDER MATTERS:
• Run cells in order for best results
• Variables must be defined before use
• Imports should come first
• Can run cells out of order, but be careful!
