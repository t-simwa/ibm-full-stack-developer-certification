OVERVIEW
--------
A type is how Python represents different types of data. In Python, you can have 
different types of data. They can be integers like 11, real numbers like 21.213, 
they can even be words. Integers, real numbers, and words can be expressed as 
different data types. Understanding types is fundamental to programming because 
they determine what operations you can perform on data and how Python stores and 
processes information.

This guide will walk you through:
• What types are and why they exist
• How to identify types using the type() command

PART 1: UNDERSTANDING TYPES IN PYTHON
================================================================================

SECTION 1.1: WHAT ARE TYPES?
-----------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
A type is how Python represents different types of data.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
In Python, every piece of data has a type. The type tells Python what kind of 
data it is and what operations can be performed on it. Think of types as 
categories or classifications that Python uses to understand and work with data.

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of types like containers in a kitchen:
• You have containers for liquids (cups, bottles)
• You have containers for solids (plates, bowls)
• You have containers for frozen items (freezer bags)
• Each container is designed for a specific type of content
• You can't pour liquid into a plate meant for solid food
• Similarly, Python has different "containers" (types) for different data

Or think of types like different tools:
• A hammer is designed for nails
• A screwdriver is designed for screws
• A wrench is designed for bolts
• Each tool works best with specific materials
• Similarly, each Python type works best with specific operations

WHY TYPES EXIST
---------------
Types exist because:
1. They help Python understand what operations are valid
   • You can add two numbers: 5 + 3 = 8
   • But you can't add two words in the same way: "hello" + "world" = "helloworld" (concatenation, not addition)
   
2. They determine how data is stored in memory
   • An integer might take 4 bytes
   • A float might take 8 bytes
   • A string might take variable bytes depending on length

3. They prevent errors
   • Python won't let you divide a word by a number
   • Python won't let you perform mathematical operations on text

4. They make code more predictable
   • If you know something is an integer, you know what operations work
   • If you know something is a string, you know what methods are available

EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT TYPES
---------------------------
You can have different types in Python. They can be:
• Integers like 11
• Real numbers like 21.213
• Words (strings) like "hello" or "Python"

Let's see examples:

EXAMPLE 1: INTEGER
-------------------
  11

WHAT THIS IS:
• This is an integer (whole number)
• Type: int
• Can be used for counting, calculations, indexing

EXAMPLE 2: REAL NUMBER
-----------------------
  21.213

WHAT THIS IS:
• This is a real number (decimal number)
• Type: float
• Can be used for measurements, calculations requiring precision

EXAMPLE 3: WORDS
----------------
  "hello"
  "Python"
  "data science"

WHAT THESE ARE:
• These are strings (sequences of characters)
• Type: str
• Can be used for text, messages, names, descriptions

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DATA AND TYPES
---------------------------------------
Integers, real numbers, and words can be expressed as different data types. 
This means:
• The same concept (like "11") can be stored as different types
• "11" as an integer: 11 (type: int)
• "11" as a string: "11" (type: str)
• The type determines what you can do with the data

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
Understanding types is crucial because:
• It helps you write correct code
• It prevents errors and bugs
• It makes your code more efficient
• It helps you understand error messages
• It enables you to convert between types when needed

[END SECTION 1.1]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.2: THE TYPE() COMMAND - IDENTIFYING TYPES
----------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
We can see the actual data type in Python by using the type command.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The type() command (or function) is Python's built-in tool for identifying what 
type a piece of data is. It's like asking Python: "What type is this data?" 
and Python responds with the type name.

SYNTAX
------
The type() command has this syntax:

  type(value)

WHERE:
• type → The command/function name
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• value → The data you want to check
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT TYPE() RETURNS
-------------------
The type() command returns a type object that tells you what type the data is. 
When you use type() in Python, it shows you the type class name.

EXAMPLE 1: CHECKING AN INTEGER TYPE
------------------------------------
Let's check the type of the integer 11:

  type(11)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a single-line command:
• type → The type() function that identifies data types
• ( → Opening parenthesis that starts the function call
• 11 → The integer value we want to check
• ) → Closing parenthesis that ends the function call

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the type() function
2. Python evaluates what's inside the parentheses: 11
3. Python identifies that 11 is an integer
4. Python returns: <class 'int'>

THE RESULT:
The output will be: <class 'int'>

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• <class 'int'> means the value is of type int (integer)
• The word "class" refers to the type category
• "int" is short for integer

EXAMPLE 2: CHECKING A FLOAT TYPE
----------------------------------
Let's check the type of the real number 21.213:

  type(21.213)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This command checks the type of a decimal number:
• type → The type() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 21.213 → The float value we want to check (notice the decimal point)
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the type() function
2. Python evaluates what's inside: 21.213
3. Python identifies that 21.213 is a float (real number)
4. Python returns: <class 'float'>

THE RESULT:
The output will be: <class 'float'>

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• <class 'float'> means the value is of type float
• Float stands for "floating-point number" (a number with a decimal point)

EXAMPLE 3: CHECKING A STRING TYPE
----------------------------------
Let's check the type of a word:

  type("hello")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This command checks the type of text:
• type → The type() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "hello" → The string value (notice the quotes)
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the type() function
2. Python evaluates what's inside: "hello"
3. Python identifies that "hello" is a string
4. Python returns: <class 'str'>

THE RESULT:
The output will be: <class 'str'>

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• <class 'str'> means the value is of type str (string)
• Str is short for string (a sequence of characters)

USING TYPE() IN PRACTICE
-------------------------
You can use type() to:
• Debug your code when something isn't working
• Verify that data is the type you expect
• Understand what operations are available
• Learn about Python's type system

EXAMPLE: CHECKING MULTIPLE VALUES
----------------------------------
You can check multiple values:

  type(5)        # Returns: <class 'int'>
  type(5.0)      # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type("5")      # Returns: <class 'str'>

NOTICE:
• 5 is an integer
• 5.0 is a float (even though it represents the same number)
• "5" is a string (text, not a number)

THIS IS IMPORTANT:
Even though these represent similar concepts, they are different types and 
behave differently in operations.

[END SECTION 1.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.3: INTEGERS (INT) - WHOLE NUMBERS
---------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
We can have int, which stands for an integer.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
An integer (int) is a whole number - a number without a decimal point. Integers 
can be positive, negative, or zero. They are used for counting, indexing, and 
mathematical operations that require whole numbers.

WHAT IS AN INTEGER?
-------------------
An integer is:
• A whole number (no decimal part)
• Can be positive: 1, 2, 3, 100, 1000
• Can be negative: -1, -2, -3, -100, -1000
• Can be zero: 0

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
-------------------
Integers are used for:
• Counting items: "I have 5 apples"
• Age: "I am 25 years old"
• Temperature: "It's -5 degrees outside"
• Index positions: "The first item is at position 0"
• Quantities: "I need 10 books"

EXAMPLES OF INTEGERS
--------------------
Here are some integers:

EXAMPLE 1: POSITIVE INTEGERS
-----------------------------
  11
  100
  1000
  999999

WHAT THESE ARE:
• All are positive whole numbers
• All are type: int
• Can be used in calculations

EXAMPLE 2: NEGATIVE INTEGERS
-----------------------------
  -5
  -100
  -1000

WHAT THESE ARE:
• All are negative whole numbers
• All are type: int
• Represent values below zero

EXAMPLE 3: ZERO
---------------
  0

WHAT THIS IS:
• Zero is also an integer
• It's neither positive nor negative
• Type: int

CHARACTERISTICS OF INTEGERS
---------------------------
Integers can be negative or positive. This means:
• Python supports both positive and negative integers
• You can perform operations with negative numbers
• Negative numbers are useful for representing:
  - Temperatures below zero
  - Debts or losses
  - Directions (left/right, up/down)
  - Differences or changes

THE RANGE OF INTEGERS
---------------------
It should be noted that there is a finite range of integers but it is quite large.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Integers don't go on forever
• There's a maximum and minimum value
• However, the range is very large (practically unlimited for most uses)

IN PYTHON 3:
• Integers can be arbitrarily large
• There's no fixed maximum size
• Limited only by available memory
• For example: 10**1000 is a valid integer

WHY THERE'S A LIMIT
-------------------
Even though Python 3 allows very large integers, there are still limits:
• Your computer's memory limits how large integers can be
• Very large integers take more memory to store
• Operations on very large integers take more time

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------
For most practical purposes:
• You'll rarely hit integer limits
• Python handles large integers automatically
• You don't need to worry about overflow errors (unlike some languages)

USING INTEGERS IN CODE
-----------------------
EXAMPLE 1: BASIC INTEGER OPERATIONS
------------------------------------
  5 + 3        # Result: 8 (type: int)
  10 - 4       # Result: 6 (type: int)
  2 * 5        # Result: 10 (type: int)
  15 // 3      # Result: 5 (type: int) - integer division

EXAMPLE 2: CHECKING INTEGER TYPE
---------------------------------
  type(11)     # Returns: <class 'int'>
  type(-5)     # Returns: <class 'int'>
  type(0)      # Returns: <class 'int'>

EXAMPLE 3: INTEGER VARIABLES
-----------------------------
  age = 25
  count = 100
  temperature = -5
  
  type(age)        # Returns: <class 'int'>
  type(count)      # Returns: <class 'int'>
  type(temperature) # Returns: <class 'int'>

COMMON INTEGER OPERATIONS
-------------------------
You can perform these operations on integers:
• Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
• Subtraction: 10 - 4 = 6
• Multiplication: 2 * 5 = 10
• Integer division: 15 // 3 = 5 (returns integer)
• Modulo: 10 % 3 = 1 (remainder)
• Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8 (2 to the power of 3)

WHEN TO USE INTEGERS
--------------------
Use integers when:
• You need whole numbers only
• You're counting items
• You're working with indices or positions
• You need exact values (no rounding)
• You're performing integer arithmetic

[END SECTION 1.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 1.4: FLOATS (FLOAT) - REAL NUMBERS
-------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Float stands for float, essentially a real number.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
A float (floating-point number) is a real number - a number that can have a 
decimal point. Floats include integers but also numbers in between the integers. 
They are used for measurements, calculations requiring precision, and any 
situation where decimal values are needed.

WHAT IS A FLOAT?
----------------
A float is:
• A real number (can have decimal part)
• Can be positive: 3.14, 21.213, 100.5
• Can be negative: -3.14, -21.213, -100.5
• Can be zero: 0.0
• Can be whole numbers: 2.0, 100.0 (but stored as float)

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
-------------------
Floats are used for:
• Measurements: "The length is 3.5 meters"
• Money: "The price is $19.99"
• Percentages: "The interest rate is 4.5%"
• Scientific calculations: "The speed is 299792458.0 m/s"
• Coordinates: "The location is at 40.7128° latitude"

EXAMPLES OF FLOATS
------------------
Here are some floats:

EXAMPLE 1: DECIMAL NUMBERS
---------------------------
  21.213
  3.14
  0.5
  99.99

WHAT THESE ARE:
• All are real numbers with decimal points
• All are type: float
• Can represent precise measurements

EXAMPLE 2: NEGATIVE FLOATS
---------------------------
  -21.213
  -3.14
  -0.5

WHAT THESE ARE:
• All are negative real numbers
• All are type: float
• Represent values below zero with precision

EXAMPLE 3: WHOLE NUMBERS AS FLOATS
-----------------------------------
  2.0
  100.0
  0.0

WHAT THESE ARE:
• These look like integers but are floats
• The .0 makes them floats
• Type: float (not int)

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLOATS AND INTEGERS
---------------------------------------------
Floats are real numbers. They include the integers but also numbers in between 
the integers.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Every integer can be represented as a float: 5 = 5.0
• But floats can also represent values between integers: 5.5, 5.7, 5.99
• Floats provide more precision than integers

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
Think of a number line:

  Integers:    ... -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5  ...
  
  Floats:      ... -2.5 -1.3 0.0 1.7 2.9 3.14 4.5 5.8 ...
                (includes all integers AND values in between)

UNDERSTANDING DECIMAL PRECISION
--------------------------------
Consider the numbers between 0 and 1. We can select numbers in between them. 
These numbers are floats.

EXAMPLES:
• 0.1 is a float (between 0 and 1)
• 0.5 is a float (between 0 and 1)
• 0.9 is a float (between 0 and 1)
• 0.123456789 is a float (between 0 and 1)

Similarly, consider the numbers between 0.5 and 0.6. We can select numbers in 
between them. These are floats as well.

EXAMPLES:
• 0.51 is a float (between 0.5 and 0.6)
• 0.55 is a float (between 0.5 and 0.6)
• 0.59 is a float (between 0.5 and 0.6)
• 0.555555555 is a float (between 0.5 and 0.6)

THE CONCEPT OF INFINITE PRECISION
----------------------------------
We can continue the process zooming in for different numbers. This means:
• Between any two floats, there are infinitely many other floats
• For example, between 0.5 and 0.6, there's 0.55, 0.555, 0.5555, etc.
• This allows for very precise measurements

PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS
---------------------
Of course there is a limit but it is quite small.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Computers can't store infinitely precise numbers
• There's a limit to how many decimal places can be represented
• However, this limit is very small (usually 15-17 significant digits)
• For most practical purposes, this precision is sufficient

FLOATING-POINT PRECISION
------------------------
Floats have limited precision because:
• They're stored in binary format
• Some decimal numbers can't be represented exactly in binary
• This can lead to rounding errors in calculations

EXAMPLE OF PRECISION LIMITATION:
  0.1 + 0.2

You might expect: 0.3
But Python might show: 0.30000000000000004

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
• 0.1 and 0.2 can't be represented exactly in binary
• The result is very close to 0.3 but not exactly 0.3
• This is normal and expected behavior

USING FLOATS IN CODE
---------------------
EXAMPLE 1: BASIC FLOAT OPERATIONS
-----------------------------------
  3.14 + 2.86        # Result: 6.0 (type: float)
  10.5 - 4.2         # Result: 6.3 (type: float)
  2.5 * 4            # Result: 10.0 (type: float)
  15.0 / 3           # Result: 5.0 (type: float)

EXAMPLE 2: CHECKING FLOAT TYPE
-------------------------------
  type(21.213)       # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type(3.14)         # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type(2.0)          # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type(0.0)          # Returns: <class 'float'>

EXAMPLE 3: FLOAT VARIABLES
---------------------------
  price = 19.99
  temperature = 98.6
  pi = 3.14159
  
  type(price)        # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type(temperature)  # Returns: <class 'float'>
  type(pi)           # Returns: <class 'float'>

COMMON FLOAT OPERATIONS
-----------------------
You can perform these operations on floats:
• Addition: 3.5 + 2.3 = 5.8
• Subtraction: 10.7 - 4.2 = 6.5
• Multiplication: 2.5 * 4 = 10.0
• Division: 15.0 / 3 = 5.0 (returns float)
• Exponentiation: 2.5 ** 2 = 6.25

WHEN TO USE FLOATS
-------------------
Use floats when:
• You need decimal precision
• You're working with measurements
• You're calculating percentages or ratios
• You're doing scientific calculations
• You need to represent values between whole numbers

INTEGERS VS FLOATS - KEY DIFFERENCES
-------------------------------------
INTEGERS (int):
• Whole numbers only: 5, -10, 0
• No decimal point
• Exact values
• Use for counting, indexing

FLOATS (float):
• Can have decimals: 5.5, -10.7, 0.0
• Has decimal point
• Approximate precision (limited)
• Use for measurements, calculations

================================================================================

SECTION 1.5: STRINGS (STR) - SEQUENCES OF CHARACTERS
------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The type string is a sequence of characters.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
A string (str) is a data type that represents text - a sequence of characters. 
Strings can contain letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation marks, and special 
characters. In Python, strings are enclosed in quotes (single, double, or triple 
quotes).

WHAT IS A STRING?
-----------------
A string is:
• A sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols)
• Enclosed in quotes: "hello" or 'hello'
• Can be empty: "" or ''
• Can contain spaces: "hello world"
• Can contain numbers as text: "123" (not the number 123)

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
-------------------
Strings are used for:
• Names: "John", "Mary", "Python"
• Messages: "Hello, world!"
• Descriptions: "This is a comprehensive guide"
• Addresses: "123 Main Street"
• Phone numbers stored as text: "555-1234"
• Any text data you need to store or display

EXAMPLES OF STRINGS
-------------------
Here are some strings:

EXAMPLE 1: SIMPLE WORDS
------------------------
  "hello"
  "Python"
  "data"

WHAT THESE ARE:
• All are sequences of characters
• All are type: str
• Enclosed in double quotes

EXAMPLE 2: PHRASES AND SENTENCES
---------------------------------
  "hello world"
  "Python programming"
  "data science"

WHAT THESE ARE:
• Strings can contain spaces
• Still type: str
• Spaces are part of the string

EXAMPLE 3: NUMBERS AS STRINGS
------------------------------
  "11"
  "21.213"
  "12345"

WHAT THESE ARE:
• These look like numbers but are strings
• The quotes make them text, not numbers
• Type: str (not int or float)
• Cannot be used in mathematical operations directly

CHARACTERISTICS OF STRINGS
--------------------------
A string is a sequence of characters. This means:

SEQUENCE:
• Characters are in a specific order
• "hello" is different from "olleh"
• Order matters in strings

CHARACTERS:
• Each character is a single symbol
• "hello" has 5 characters: h, e, l, l, o
• Characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation

IMMUTABILITY:
• Strings cannot be changed once created
• You can create new strings but not modify existing ones
• This is important for understanding string operations

STRING QUOTES IN PYTHON
------------------------
Python allows three types of quotes for strings:

SINGLE QUOTES:
  'hello'
  'Python programming'

DOUBLE QUOTES:
  "hello"
  "Python programming"

TRIPLE QUOTES (for multi-line strings):
  """This is a
  multi-line
  string"""

WHY MULTIPLE QUOTE TYPES?
--------------------------
Different quote types are useful for:
• Including quotes within strings: "He said 'Hello'"
• Multi-line text: """Line 1
Line 2"""
• Consistency with coding style preferences

USING STRINGS IN CODE
---------------------
EXAMPLE 1: BASIC STRING OPERATIONS
-----------------------------------
  "hello" + " " + "world"    # Result: "hello world" (concatenation)
  "Python" * 3               # Result: "PythonPythonPython" (repetition)
  len("hello")               # Result: 5 (length of string)

EXAMPLE 2: CHECKING STRING TYPE
--------------------------------
  type("hello")              # Returns: <class 'str'>
  type("11")                 # Returns: <class 'str'>
  type("21.213")             # Returns: <class 'str'>
  type("")                   # Returns: <class 'str'> (empty string)

EXAMPLE 3: STRING VARIABLES
-----------------------------
  name = "John"
  message = "Hello, world!"
  number_as_text = "123"
  
  type(name)                 # Returns: <class 'str'>
  type(message)              # Returns: <class 'str'>
  type(number_as_text)       # Returns: <class 'str'>

COMMON STRING OPERATIONS
------------------------
You can perform these operations on strings:
• Concatenation: "hello" + "world" = "helloworld"
• Repetition: "hi" * 3 = "hihihi"
• Length: len("hello") = 5
• Indexing: "hello"[0] = "h" (first character)
• Slicing: "hello"[0:2] = "he" (characters from index 0 to 1)

IMPORTANT: STRINGS VS NUMBERS
------------------------------
Remember that strings containing numbers are NOT numbers:

  "11"        # This is a STRING (text)
  11          # This is an INTEGER (number)
  
  "21.213"    # This is a STRING (text)
  21.213      # This is a FLOAT (number)

YOU CANNOT DO THIS:
  "11" + 5    # ERROR! Can't add string and integer

YOU CAN DO THIS:
  "11" + "5"  # Result: "115" (string concatenation)
  11 + 5      # Result: 16 (integer addition)

WHEN TO USE STRINGS
-------------------
Use strings when:
• You need to store text data
• You're working with names, addresses, descriptions
• You're displaying messages to users
• You're reading text from files
• You're processing user input (which comes as strings)
• You need to store numbers that shouldn't be calculated (like phone numbers)

SUMMARY OF THE THREE MAIN TYPES
--------------------------------
INT (INTEGER):
