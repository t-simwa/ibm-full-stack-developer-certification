================================================================================

WELCOME TO PART 2
-----------------
Welcome to Part 2 of "Types in Python". This part focuses on type conversion 
(typecasting) - the process of converting data from one type to another. You'll 
learn how to convert between integers, floats, strings, and booleans, when to 
do it, and what to watch out for. You'll also learn about the Boolean type, 
which represents True and False values, and how booleans interact with other types.

ESTIMATED TIME NEEDED
---------------------
5 minutes (for basic reading)
60-90 minutes (for comprehensive study with practice and reflection)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-------------------
After studying this guide, you will be able to:
• Understand what typecasting is and why it's useful
• Convert integers to floats and vice versa
• Convert strings to numbers (int and float)
• Convert numbers to strings
• Understand the Boolean type (bool) and its values
• Convert between booleans and numbers
• Recognize when type conversion happens automatically
• Avoid common type conversion errors

OVERVIEW
--------
You can change the type of the expression in Python, this is called typecasting. 
Type conversion is essential when you need to perform operations between 
different types or when you receive data in one format but need it in another. 
Understanding typecasting helps you write more flexible and robust Python programs.

This guide will walk you through:
• What typecasting is and how it works
• Converting integers to floats
• Converting floats to integers (and what gets lost)
• Converting strings to integers and floats
• Converting numbers to strings
• The Boolean type (True and False)

PART 2: TYPE CONVERSION (TYPECASTING) AND BOOLEANS
================================================================================

SECTION 2.1: WHAT IS TYPECASTING?
----------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
You can change the type of the expression in Python, this is called typecasting.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Typecasting (also called type conversion) is the process of converting a value 
from one data type to another. It's like translating between different languages 
- you're taking data in one format and converting it to another format that 
Python can work with differently.

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of typecasting like unit conversion:
• You have 5 feet, but you need it in meters
• You convert: 5 feet = 1.524 meters
• Same value, different representation

Or think of it like currency conversion:
• You have $100 USD
• You convert it to euros: €85
• Same value, different currency (type)

WHY TYPECASTING IS NEEDED
-------------------------
Typecasting is needed because:
1. Different operations require different types
   • You can't add a string and a number directly
   • You need to convert one to match the other

2. Data comes in different formats
   • User input is always a string
   • You might need it as a number for calculations

3. You need to ensure correct types
   • Sometimes you're not sure what type something is
   • Converting ensures you have the right type

4. You want to display numbers as text
   • Numbers need to be converted to strings for display
   • Or for creating formatted messages

HOW TYPECASTING WORKS
---------------------
Typecasting uses type constructor functions:
• int() - converts to integer
• float() - converts to float
• str() - converts to string
• bool() - converts to boolean

SYNTAX
------
The general syntax is:

  target_type(value)

WHERE:
• target_type → The type you want (int, float, str, bool)
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• value → The value you want to convert
• ) → Closing parenthesis

EXAMPLE: BASIC TYPECASTING
---------------------------
  int(5.7)        # Converts float to int: 5
  float(5)        # Converts int to float: 5.0
  str(5)          # Converts int to string: "5"

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the type constructor function (int, float, str)
2. Python takes the value inside the parentheses
3. Python converts it to the target type
4. Python returns the converted value

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
• Not all conversions are possible
• Some conversions lose information
• Some conversions cause errors
• We'll cover each type of conversion in detail

================================================================================

SECTION 2.2: CONVERTING INT TO FLOAT
-------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
You can convert an int to a float.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting an integer to a float is straightforward and safe. When you convert 
an integer to a float, you're essentially adding a decimal point (.0) to the 
number. This conversion never loses information because every integer can be 
represented exactly as a float.

WHY CONVERT INT TO FLOAT?
-------------------------
You might convert int to float when:
• You need to perform division that might result in decimals
• You're working with functions that require floats
• You want to ensure decimal precision in calculations
• You're mixing int and float in operations

HOW IT WORKS
------------
When you convert an integer to a float:
• The integer value is preserved exactly
• A decimal point (.0) is added
• The type changes from int to float
• No information is lost

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC INT TO FLOAT CONVERSION
-----------------------------------------
You can convert or cast the integer 2 to a float 2.0.

  float(2)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a type conversion expression:
• float → The float() function that converts to float type
• ( → Opening parenthesis that starts the function call
• 2 → The integer value we want to convert
• ) → Closing parenthesis that ends the function call

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the float() function
2. Python takes the integer value: 2
3. Python converts it to float: 2.0
4. Python returns: 2.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 2.0

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(float(2))    # Returns: <class 'float'>

VERIFICATION:
  float(2) == 2.0   # Returns: True (they represent the same value)

EXAMPLE 2: CONVERTING NEGATIVE INTEGERS
----------------------------------------
  float(-5)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a negative integer:
• float → The float() conversion function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• -5 → The negative integer value
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the integer: -5
2. Python converts it to float: -5.0
3. Python returns: -5.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: -5.0

EXAMPLE 3: CONVERTING ZERO
---------------------------
  float(0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts zero:
• float → The float() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 0 → The integer zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the integer: 0
2. Python converts it to float: 0.0
3. Python returns: 0.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 0.0

EXAMPLE 4: CONVERTING LARGE INTEGERS
-------------------------------------
  float(1000)
  float(-999999)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
These convert large integers:
• float(1000) → Converts 1000 to 1000.0
• float(-999999) → Converts -999999 to -999999.0

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Large integers are converted the same way as small ones
2. The value is preserved exactly
3. Only the type changes (int → float)

THE RESULTS:
  float(1000)      # Returns: 1000.0
  float(-999999)   # Returns: -999999.0

PRESERVATION OF VALUE
---------------------
Nothing really changes when converting int to float. This means:
• The numeric value stays exactly the same
• 2 becomes 2.0 (same value, different type)
• -5 becomes -5.0 (same value, different type)
• 0 becomes 0.0 (same value, different type)

WHY NOTHING CHANGES
-------------------
The value doesn't change because:
• Every integer can be represented exactly as a float
• Integers are a subset of floats (mathematically)
• No precision is lost in the conversion
• The decimal part is always .0

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
------------------
EXAMPLE: MIXING INT AND FLOAT IN CALCULATIONS
----------------------------------------------
When you mix int and float, Python automatically converts:

  5 + 2.5

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees int (5) and float (2.5)
2. Python automatically converts 5 to 5.0
3. Python performs: 5.0 + 2.5
4. Python returns: 7.5 (type: float)

EXPLICIT CONVERSION:
  float(5) + 2.5    # Same result: 7.5

EXAMPLE: ENSURING FLOAT RESULT
-------------------------------
If you want to ensure division results in a float:

  10 / 2            # Result: 5.0 (already float)
  float(10) / 2     # Result: 5.0 (explicit conversion)

WHEN TO USE INT TO FLOAT CONVERSION
------------------------------------
Use int to float conversion when:
• You need decimal precision in calculations
• You're dividing and want float results
• You're working with functions that require floats
• You want to ensure consistent float types

[END SECTION 2.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.3: CONVERTING FLOAT TO INT
-------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
If you cast a float to an integer, you must be careful. For example, if you 
cast the float 1.1 to 1, you will lose some information.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting a float to an integer is more complex than the reverse. When you 
convert a float to an int, Python truncates (cuts off) the decimal part. This 
means you lose the fractional portion of the number. This conversion can lose 
information, so you must be careful when doing it.

WHAT HAPPENS DURING CONVERSION
------------------------------
When you convert a float to an integer:
• Python removes the decimal part (truncation)
• The number is rounded DOWN (toward zero)
• The type changes from float to int
• Information is lost (the decimal part)

TRUNCATION EXPLAINED
--------------------
Truncation means cutting off the decimal part:
• 3.7 becomes 3 (not 4 - it's not rounding, it's truncating)
• 3.9 becomes 3 (not 4)
• 3.1 becomes 3
• -3.7 becomes -3 (toward zero, not -4)

IMPORTANT: Truncation is NOT the same as rounding!

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC FLOAT TO INT CONVERSION
-----------------------------------------
If you cast the float 1.1 to 1, you will lose some information.

  int(1.1)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is a type conversion that loses information:
• int → The int() function that converts to integer type
• ( → Opening parenthesis that starts the function call
• 1.1 → The float value we want to convert
• ) → Closing parenthesis that ends the function call

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the int() function
2. Python takes the float value: 1.1
3. Python truncates (removes) the decimal part: .1 is removed
4. Python keeps only the integer part: 1
5. Python returns: 1

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 1

WHAT WAS LOST:
• The original value was 1.1
• The converted value is 1
• The .1 (decimal part) was lost
• Information was lost in the conversion

VERIFICATION:
  int(1.1) == 1.1   # Returns: False (they're not equal!)
  int(1.1) == 1     # Returns: True (but information was lost)

EXAMPLE 2: CONVERTING VARIOUS FLOATS
-------------------------------------
  int(2.0)          # Result: 2 (no loss, was already whole)
  int(2.5)          # Result: 2 (lost .5)
  int(2.9)          # Result: 2 (lost .9, NOT rounded to 3!)
  int(3.7)          # Result: 3 (lost .7)
  int(99.99)        # Result: 99 (lost .99)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
Each conversion removes the decimal part:

int(2.0):
• Input: 2.0 (float)
• Process: Remove .0
• Output: 2 (int)
• Loss: None (was already whole)

int(2.5):
• Input: 2.5 (float)
• Process: Remove .5
• Output: 2 (int)
• Loss: 0.5 was lost

int(2.9):
• Input: 2.9 (float)
• Process: Remove .9
• Output: 2 (int)
• Loss: 0.9 was lost
• IMPORTANT: NOT rounded to 3! It's truncated to 2.

int(3.7):
• Input: 3.7 (float)
• Process: Remove .7
• Output: 3 (int)
• Loss: 0.7 was lost

int(99.99):
• Input: 99.99 (float)
• Process: Remove .99
• Output: 99 (int)
• Loss: 0.99 was lost

EXAMPLE 3: NEGATIVE FLOATS
---------------------------
  int(-1.1)         # Result: -1 (lost .1, but kept negative)
  int(-2.5)         # Result: -2 (lost .5, NOT -3!)
  int(-2.9)         # Result: -2 (lost .9, NOT -3!)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
Negative floats truncate toward zero:

int(-1.1):
• Input: -1.1 (float)
• Process: Remove .1, keep -1
• Output: -1 (int)
• Loss: 0.1 was lost

int(-2.5):
• Input: -2.5 (float)
• Process: Remove .5, keep -2 (toward zero)
• Output: -2 (int)
• Loss: 0.5 was lost
• IMPORTANT: NOT -3! Truncation goes toward zero.

int(-2.9):
• Input: -2.9 (float)
• Process: Remove .9, keep -2 (toward zero)
• Output: -2 (int)
• Loss: 0.9 was lost
• IMPORTANT: NOT -3! Still truncates toward zero.

UNDERSTANDING TRUNCATION VS ROUNDING
-------------------------------------
TRUNCATION (what int() does):
• Cuts off the decimal part
• Always goes toward zero
• 2.9 → 2 (not 3)
• -2.9 → -2 (not -3)

ROUNDING (what round() does):
• Rounds to nearest integer
• Can go up or down
• 2.9 → 3
• 2.4 → 2

COMPARISON:
  int(2.9)          # Result: 2 (truncation)
  round(2.9)        # Result: 3 (rounding)

WHEN INFORMATION IS LOST
------------------------
Information is lost when:
• The float has a non-zero decimal part
• Examples: 1.1, 2.5, 3.7, 99.99
• The decimal portion is permanently removed

WHEN INFORMATION IS NOT LOST
----------------------------
Information is NOT lost when:
• The float is already a whole number
• Examples: 2.0, 5.0, 0.0
• The decimal part is .0 (no actual decimal value)

EXAMPLES:
  int(2.0) == 2.0   # True (no loss, was already whole)
  int(5.0) == 5.0   # True (no loss, was already whole)
  int(1.1) == 1.1   # False (loss occurred, .1 was removed)

WHEN TO USE FLOAT TO INT CONVERSION
------------------------------------
Use float to int conversion when:
• You need whole numbers only
• You're counting items (can't have half an item)
• You're working with indices (must be integers)
• You're okay with losing decimal precision
• The decimal part is not important

WHEN TO AVOID FLOAT TO INT CONVERSION
-------------------------------------
Avoid float to int conversion when:
• You need precision (like money calculations)
• The decimal part is important
• You're doing scientific calculations
• You need accurate measurements

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
• Be aware that conversion loses information
• Only convert when you're sure you don't need decimals
• Consider using round() if you want rounding instead
• Document why you're converting if it's not obvious

[END SECTION 2.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.4: CONVERTING STRINGS TO NUMBERS
-------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
If a string contains an integer value, you can convert it to int. If we convert 
a string that contains a non-integer value, we get an error.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting strings to numbers is very common in programming. User input, data 
from files, and data from APIs often come as strings, but you need them as 
numbers for calculations. Python can convert strings to numbers, but only if 
the string contains a valid number representation.

WHY CONVERT STRINGS TO NUMBERS?
--------------------------------
Strings to number conversion is needed because:
1. User input is always a string
   • When users type "25", it's the string "25", not the number 25
   • You need to convert it to use it in calculations

2. Data from files is often strings
   • CSV files, text files contain numbers as text
   • You need to convert them to perform operations

3. Data from APIs comes as strings
   • JSON data often has numbers as strings
   • Conversion is needed for calculations

HOW IT WORKS
------------
When converting strings to numbers:
• Python reads the string character by character
• Python checks if it's a valid number representation
• If valid, Python converts it to the number type
• If invalid, Python raises an error

CONVERTING STRINGS TO INTEGERS
-------------------------------
If a string contains an integer value, you can convert it to int.

EXAMPLE 1: VALID INTEGER STRING
--------------------------------
  int("11")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a string containing an integer:
• int → The int() function that converts to integer
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "11" → The string containing the number 11 (notice the quotes)
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the int() function
2. Python takes the string: "11"
3. Python reads the characters: '1' and '1'
4. Python recognizes this as a valid integer representation
5. Python converts it to integer: 11
6. Python returns: 11

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 11 (type: int, not str)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(int("11"))   # Returns: <class 'int'>

VERIFICATION:
  int("11") == 11   # Returns: True (same value)

EXAMPLE 2: NEGATIVE INTEGER STRING
-----------------------------------
  int("-5")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a negative integer string:
• int → The int() conversion function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "-5" → The string containing negative five
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads the string: "-5"
2. Python recognizes the minus sign and the number
3. Python converts it to integer: -5
4. Python returns: -5

THE RESULT:
The output will be: -5 (type: int)

EXAMPLE 3: ZERO AS STRING
--------------------------
  int("0")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts zero as a string:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "0" → The string containing zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads the string: "0"
2. Python recognizes it as zero
3. Python converts it to integer: 0
4. Python returns: 0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 0 (type: int)

CONVERTING STRINGS TO FLOATS
-----------------------------
You can also convert strings to floats:

EXAMPLE 1: VALID FLOAT STRING
------------------------------
  float("21.213")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a string containing a float:
• float → The float() function that converts to float
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "21.213" → The string containing the decimal number
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads the string: "21.213"
2. Python recognizes the decimal point
3. Python converts it to float: 21.213
4. Python returns: 21.213

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 21.213 (type: float)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(float("21.213"))   # Returns: <class 'float'>

EXAMPLE 2: INTEGER STRING TO FLOAT
-----------------------------------
  float("11")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts an integer string to float:
• float → The float() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "11" → The string containing 11
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads the string: "11"
2. Python converts it to float: 11.0
3. Python returns: 11.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 11.0 (type: float)

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CONVERSION FAILS
-----------------------------------
If we convert a string that contains a non-integer value, we get an error.

EXAMPLE 1: INVALID STRING FOR INT
-----------------------------------
  int("hello")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This tries to convert a non-numeric string:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "hello" → A string that doesn't contain a number
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the int() function
2. Python reads the string: "hello"
3. Python tries to find a number in "hello"
4. Python finds no valid number representation
5. Python raises an error: ValueError

THE ERROR:
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Python cannot convert "hello" to an integer
• "hello" doesn't represent a number
• The conversion failed

EXAMPLE 2: FLOAT STRING TO INT (DIRECTLY)
------------------------------------------
  int("21.213")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This tries to convert a float string directly to int:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "21.213" → A string containing a decimal number
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads the string: "21.213"
2. Python sees a decimal point
3. Python cannot convert directly to int (needs to be float first)
4. Python raises an error: ValueError

THE ERROR:
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '21.213'

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• You can't convert a float string directly to int
• You must convert to float first, then to int
• Two-step process needed

THE SOLUTION:
  int(float("21.213"))   # First to float, then to int: 21

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. float("21.213") → 21.213 (float)
2. int(21.213) → 21 (int, decimal removed)

EXAMPLE 3: EMPTY STRING
------------------------
  int("")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This tries to convert an empty string:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• "" → An empty string (no characters)
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python reads an empty string
2. Python finds no number to convert
3. Python raises an error: ValueError

THE ERROR:
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID
----------------------
ERROR 1: Converting text strings
  int("hello")        # ERROR: ValueError

ERROR 2: Converting float strings directly to int
  int("3.14")         # ERROR: ValueError
  int(float("3.14"))  # CORRECT: 3

ERROR 3: Converting empty strings
  int("")             # ERROR: ValueError

ERROR 4: Strings with spaces
  int(" 5 ")          # ERROR: ValueError (has spaces)
  int("5")            # CORRECT: 5

VALID STRING FORMATS FOR CONVERSION
-----------------------------------
VALID FOR INT:
• "11" → 11
• "-5" → -5
• "0" → 0
• "999" → 999

VALID FOR FLOAT:
• "21.213" → 21.213
• "-3.14" → -3.14
• "5.0" → 5.0
• "0.0" → 0.0

INVALID:
• "hello" → ERROR
• "3.14" (for int) → ERROR (use float first)
• "" → ERROR
• " 5 " → ERROR (spaces not allowed)

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
------------------
EXAMPLE: USER INPUT CONVERSION
-------------------------------
When users enter data, it comes as a string:

  user_age = input("Enter your age: ")  # User types "25"
  # user_age is the string "25", not the number 25
  
  age = int(user_age)  # Convert to integer: 25
  # Now age is the integer 25
  
  next_year = age + 1  # Can do math: 26

EXAMPLE: CALCULATING WITH STRING NUMBERS
----------------------------------------
  price_str = "19.99"        # String from file or API
  price = float(price_str)   # Convert to float: 19.99
  total = price * 2          # Can calculate: 39.98

================================================================================

SECTION 2.5: CONVERTING NUMBERS TO STRINGS
-------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
You can convert an int to a string or a float to a string.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting numbers to strings is essential when you need to display numbers as 
text, combine numbers with text in messages, or write numbers to files. Python 
makes this conversion straightforward using the str() function.

WHY CONVERT NUMBERS TO STRINGS?
-------------------------------
Numbers to string conversion is needed because:
1. Displaying numbers in messages
   • "Your age is " + 25 → ERROR (can't add string and int)
   • "Your age is " + str(25) → "Your age is 25" (works!)

2. Writing numbers to files
   • Files store text, not numbers
   • Numbers must be converted to strings first

3. Formatting output
   • Creating formatted messages with numbers
   • Building strings that include numeric values

HOW IT WORKS
------------
When converting numbers to strings:
• Python takes the numeric value
• Python converts it to its text representation
• The type changes from number to string
• No information is lost (the value is preserved as text)

CONVERTING INT TO STRING
------------------------
You can convert an int to a string.

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC INT TO STRING
--------------------------------
  str(11)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts an integer to a string:
• str → The str() function that converts to string
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 11 → The integer value we want to convert
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the str() function
2. Python takes the integer: 11
3. Python converts it to its string representation: "11"
4. Python returns: "11"

THE RESULT:
The output will be: "11" (type: str, not int)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(str(11))   # Returns: <class 'str'>

VERIFICATION:
  str(11) == "11"  # Returns: True (same text representation)

EXAMPLE 2: NEGATIVE INT TO STRING
----------------------------------
  str(-5)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a negative integer:
• str → The str() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• -5 → The negative integer
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the integer: -5
2. Python converts it to string: "-5"
3. Python returns: "-5"

THE RESULT:
The output will be: "-5" (type: str)

EXAMPLE 3: ZERO TO STRING
--------------------------
  str(0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts zero:
• str → The str() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 0 → The integer zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the integer: 0
2. Python converts it to string: "0"
3. Python returns: "0"

THE RESULT:
The output will be: "0" (type: str)

CONVERTING FLOAT TO STRING
---------------------------
You can convert a float to a string.

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC FLOAT TO STRING
----------------------------------
  str(21.213)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a float to a string:
• str → The str() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 21.213 → The float value we want to convert
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the str() function
2. Python takes the float: 21.213
3. Python converts it to its string representation: "21.213"
4. Python returns: "21.213"

THE RESULT:
The output will be: "21.213" (type: str)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(str(21.213))   # Returns: <class 'str'>

EXAMPLE 2: WHOLE NUMBER FLOAT TO STRING
----------------------------------------
  str(2.0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts a whole number float:
• str → The str() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 2.0 → The float value (whole number as float)
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the float: 2.0
2. Python converts it to string: "2.0"
3. Python returns: "2.0"

THE RESULT:
The output will be: "2.0" (type: str)

NOTICE:
• The .0 is preserved in the string
• "2.0" is different from "2" (both are strings, but different text)

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
------------------
EXAMPLE 1: CREATING MESSAGES WITH NUMBERS
------------------------------------------
  age = 25
  message = "I am " + str(age) + " years old"
  # Result: "I am 25 years old"

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This creates a message combining text and numbers:
• age = 25 → Integer variable
• "I am " → String literal (text)
• + → String concatenation operator
• str(age) → Converts 25 to "25"
• + → String concatenation operator
• " years old" → String literal (text)
• message → Contains the combined string

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. str(age) converts 25 to "25"
2. "I am " + "25" = "I am 25"
3. "I am 25" + " years old" = "I am 25 years old"
4. message stores the final string

WHY STR() IS NEEDED:
Without str(), this would fail:
  "I am " + 25  # ERROR: can't concatenate str and int

With str(), it works:
  "I am " + str(25)  # Works: "I am 25"

EXAMPLE 2: FORMATTING PRICES
-----------------------------
  price = 19.99
  display = "$" + str(price)
  # Result: "$19.99"

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This formats a price for display:
• price = 19.99 → Float variable
• "$" → String with dollar sign
• + → String concatenation
• str(price) → Converts 19.99 to "19.99"
• display → Contains "$19.99"

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. str(price) converts 19.99 to "19.99"
2. "$" + "19.99" = "$19.99"
3. display stores the formatted string

EXAMPLE 3: BUILDING COMPLEX MESSAGES
-------------------------------------
  count = 5
  total = 99.50
  summary = "You have " + str(count) + " items totaling $" + str(total)
  # Result: "You have 5 items totaling $99.5"

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This builds a complex message with multiple numbers:
• count = 5 → Integer
• total = 99.50 → Float
• "You have " → String
• + → Concatenation
• str(count) → "5"
• + → Concatenation
• " items totaling $" → String
• + → Concatenation
• str(total) → "99.5"
• summary → Final combined string

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. str(count) → "5"
2. str(total) → "99.5"
3. All parts concatenated: "You have 5 items totaling $99.5"

WHEN TO USE NUMBER TO STRING CONVERSION
----------------------------------------
Use number to string conversion when:
• Displaying numbers in user messages
• Writing numbers to text files
• Building formatted output strings
• Combining numbers with text
• Creating file names with numbers
• Logging numeric values as text

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
• Converting numbers to strings never fails (unlike string to number)
• All numeric values can be represented as strings
• The string representation preserves the value as text
• Once converted to string, you can't do math (it's text, not a number)

================================================================================

SECTION 2.6: BOOLEAN TYPE (BOOL) - TRUE AND FALSE
---------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Boolean is another important type in Python. A Boolean can take on two values. 
The first value is True, just remember we use an uppercase T. Boolean values can 
also be False with an uppercase F.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Boolean (bool) is a fundamental data type that represents truth values. It can 
only have two possible values: True or False. Booleans are essential for 
decision-making in programs - they control if statements, loops, and logical 
operations. The name "Boolean" comes from George Boole, a mathematician who 
developed Boolean algebra.

WHAT IS A BOOLEAN?
------------------
A Boolean is:
• A data type with only two possible values
• True (representing truth, yes, on, 1)
• False (representing falsehood, no, off, 0)
• Used for logical operations and decision-making

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of booleans like a light switch:
• True = Light is ON
• False = Light is OFF
• Only two states possible

Or think of them like yes/no questions:
• "Is it raining?" → True or False
• "Are you ready?" → True or False
• "Is 5 greater than 3?" → True

WHY BOOLEANS MATTER
-------------------
Booleans are important because:
1. They control program flow
   • if statements use booleans
   • while loops use booleans
   • Logical operations return booleans

2. They represent conditions
   • "Is this true?" → Boolean answer
   • "Should I do this?" → Boolean decision

3. They enable decision-making
   • Programs make choices based on boolean values
   • Different code runs based on True/False

THE TWO BOOLEAN VALUES
----------------------
A Boolean can take on two values.

VALUE 1: TRUE
-------------
The first value is True, just remember we use an uppercase T.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• True is a keyword in Python (not a string)
• The T must be uppercase: True (correct)
• Not true (incorrect - lowercase)
• Not TRUE (incorrect - all uppercase)
• Not "True" (incorrect - that's a string, not a boolean)

EXAMPLE:
  True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is the boolean value True:
• True → The boolean literal representing truth
• No quotes around it (it's not a string)
• Capital T, lowercase rest: True

WHAT THIS REPRESENTS:
• Truth, yes, on, positive, affirmative
• Used when a condition is met
• Used when something is correct

VALUE 2: FALSE
--------------
Boolean values can also be False with an uppercase F.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• False is also a keyword in Python
• The F must be uppercase: False (correct)
• Not false (incorrect - lowercase)
• Not FALSE (incorrect - all uppercase)
• Not "False" (incorrect - that's a string)

EXAMPLE:
  False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This is the boolean value False:
• False → The boolean literal representing falsehood
• No quotes around it (it's not a string)
• Capital F, lowercase rest: False

WHAT THIS REPRESENTS:
• Falsehood, no, off, negative, negative
• Used when a condition is not met
• Used when something is incorrect

CHECKING BOOLEAN TYPE
---------------------
Using the type command on a Boolean value, we obtain the term bool. This is 
short for Boolean.

EXAMPLE 1: CHECKING TRUE TYPE
------------------------------
  type(True)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This checks the type of True:
• type → The type() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• True → The boolean value True
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the type() function
2. Python evaluates True (the boolean value)
3. Python identifies it as type bool
4. Python returns: <class 'bool'>

THE RESULT:
The output will be: <class 'bool'>

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• <class 'bool'> means the value is of type bool
• Bool is short for Boolean
• This confirms True is a boolean

EXAMPLE 2: CHECKING FALSE TYPE
--------------------------------
  type(False)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This checks the type of False:
• type → The type() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• False → The boolean value False
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python evaluates False
2. Python identifies it as type bool
3. Python returns: <class 'bool'>

THE RESULT:
The output will be: <class 'bool'>

USING BOOLEANS IN CODE
----------------------
EXAMPLE 1: BOOLEAN VARIABLES
-----------------------------
  is_ready = True
  is_complete = False
  
  type(is_ready)      # Returns: <class 'bool'>
  type(is_complete)   # Returns: <class 'bool'>

EXAMPLE 2: BOOLEANS IN CONDITIONS
----------------------------------
  age = 25
  is_adult = age >= 18  # Result: True (25 >= 18)
  
  if is_adult:
      print("You are an adult")

EXAMPLE 3: COMPARISON OPERATIONS RETURN BOOLEANS
------------------------------------------------
  5 > 3        # Returns: True
  5 < 3        # Returns: False
  5 == 5       # Returns: True
  5 != 5       # Returns: False

COMMON BOOLEAN OPERATIONS
-------------------------
LOGICAL OPERATORS:
  True and True    # Returns: True
  True and False   # Returns: False
  True or False    # Returns: True
  not True         # Returns: False

COMPARISON OPERATORS (return booleans):
  5 == 5       # Returns: True
  5 != 3       # Returns: True
  5 > 3        # Returns: True
  5 < 3        # Returns: False

WHEN TO USE BOOLEANS
--------------------
Use booleans when:
• You need to represent yes/no states
• You're making decisions in code
• You're checking conditions
• You're controlling program flow
• You're representing on/off states

[END SECTION 2.6]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.7: CONVERTING BOOLEANS TO NUMBERS
--------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
If we cast a Boolean True to an integer or float, we will get a 1. If we cast 
a Boolean False to an integer or float, we get a 0.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting booleans to numbers is useful when you need numeric representations 
of truth values. Python follows a simple rule: True becomes 1, False becomes 0. 
This conversion works for both integers and floats.

WHY CONVERT BOOLEANS TO NUMBERS?
--------------------------------
Boolean to number conversion is useful when:
1. You need to count true/false values
   • Count how many items meet a condition
   • Sum up boolean results

2. You're doing mathematical operations
   • Multiply by 1 or 0 based on condition
   • Use in formulas

3. You're working with APIs that expect numbers
   • Some systems use 1/0 instead of True/False

HOW IT WORKS
------------
The conversion rule is simple:
• True → 1 (in both int and float)
• False → 0 (in both int and float)

CONVERTING TRUE TO INTEGER
---------------------------
If we cast a Boolean True to an integer or float, we will get a 1.

EXAMPLE 1: TRUE TO INTEGER
---------------------------
  int(True)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts True to an integer:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• True → The boolean value True
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the int() function
2. Python takes the boolean: True
3. Python converts True to integer: 1
4. Python returns: 1

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 1 (type: int)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(int(True))   # Returns: <class 'int'>

VERIFICATION:
  int(True) == 1    # Returns: True

CONVERTING TRUE TO FLOAT
-------------------------
  float(True)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts True to a float:
• float → The float() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• True → The boolean value True
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes True
2. Python converts it to float: 1.0
3. Python returns: 1.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 1.0 (type: float)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(float(True))   # Returns: <class 'float'>

VERIFICATION:
  float(True) == 1.0  # Returns: True

CONVERTING FALSE TO INTEGER
----------------------------
If we cast a Boolean False to an integer or float, we get a 0.

EXAMPLE 1: FALSE TO INTEGER
----------------------------
  int(False)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts False to an integer:
• int → The int() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• False → The boolean value False
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the int() function
2. Python takes the boolean: False
3. Python converts False to integer: 0
4. Python returns: 0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 0 (type: int)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(int(False))   # Returns: <class 'int'>

VERIFICATION:
  int(False) == 0    # Returns: True

CONVERTING FALSE TO FLOAT
--------------------------
  float(False)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts False to a float:
• float → The float() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• False → The boolean value False
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes False
2. Python converts it to float: 0.0
3. Python returns: 0.0

THE RESULT:
The output will be: 0.0 (type: float)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(float(False))   # Returns: <class 'float'>

VERIFICATION:
  float(False) == 0.0  # Returns: True

SUMMARY OF BOOLEAN TO NUMBER CONVERSION
----------------------------------------
TRUE CONVERSIONS:
  int(True)      # Returns: 1
  float(True)    # Returns: 1.0

FALSE CONVERSIONS:
  int(False)     # Returns: 0
  float(False)   # Returns: 0.0

THE PATTERN:
• True always becomes 1 (or 1.0)
• False always becomes 0 (or 0.0)
• This is consistent and predictable

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
------------------
EXAMPLE 1: COUNTING TRUE VALUES
--------------------------------
  results = [True, False, True, True, False]
  count = sum(int(x) for x in results)  # Converts and sums: 3

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This counts how many True values:
• results → List of booleans
• int(x) → Converts each boolean to int (True→1, False→0)
• sum() → Adds up all the 1s and 0s
• count → Total number of True values

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. True → 1, False → 0, True → 1, True → 1, False → 0
2. Sum: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
3. count = 3 (three True values)

EXAMPLE 2: USING IN CALCULATIONS
---------------------------------
  is_premium = True
  base_price = 100
  premium_fee = int(is_premium) * 20  # 1 * 20 = 20
  total = base_price + premium_fee     # 100 + 20 = 120

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This uses boolean conversion in a calculation:
• is_premium = True → Boolean variable
• base_price = 100 → Base price
• int(is_premium) → Converts True to 1
• * 20 → Multiplies by 20 (1 * 20 = 20)
• premium_fee → 20
• total → 100 + 20 = 120

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. int(True) = 1
2. 1 * 20 = 20
3. 100 + 20 = 120

[END SECTION 2.7]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.8: CONVERTING NUMBERS TO BOOLEANS
--------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
If you cast a 1 to a Boolean, you get a True. Similarly, if you cast a 0 to a 
Boolean, you get a False.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Converting numbers to booleans is the reverse of boolean to number conversion. 
Python has specific rules: 0 and 0.0 become False, and any non-zero number 
becomes True. However, the most common conversions are 1→True and 0→False.

WHY CONVERT NUMBERS TO BOOLEANS?
--------------------------------
Number to boolean conversion is useful when:
1. You need to check if a number is non-zero
   • "Is there a value?" → Boolean answer
   • "Is the count greater than zero?" → Boolean

2. You're working with flags or states
   • 1 means enabled, 0 means disabled
   • Convert to True/False for clarity

3. You're simplifying conditions
   • Instead of checking "if count > 0"
   • You can use "if bool(count)"

HOW IT WORKS
------------
The conversion rules:
• 0 → False
• 0.0 → False
• Any non-zero number → True
• 1 → True (most common)
• -1 → True (any non-zero)
• 100 → True (any non-zero)

CONVERTING 1 TO BOOLEAN
-----------------------
If you cast a 1 to a Boolean, you get a True.

EXAMPLE 1: INTEGER 1 TO BOOLEAN
---------------------------------
  bool(1)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts the integer 1 to boolean:
• bool → The bool() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 1 → The integer value one
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the bool() function
2. Python takes the integer: 1
3. Python converts 1 to boolean: True
4. Python returns: True

THE RESULT:
The output will be: True (type: bool)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(bool(1))   # Returns: <class 'bool'>

VERIFICATION:
  bool(1) == True  # Returns: True

EXAMPLE 2: FLOAT 1.0 TO BOOLEAN
--------------------------------
  bool(1.0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts the float 1.0 to boolean:
• bool → The bool() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 1.0 → The float value one point zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the float: 1.0
2. Python converts 1.0 to boolean: True
3. Python returns: True

THE RESULT:
The output will be: True (type: bool)

VERIFICATION:
  bool(1.0) == True  # Returns: True

CONVERTING 0 TO BOOLEAN
------------------------
Similarly, if you cast a 0 to a Boolean, you get a False.

EXAMPLE 1: INTEGER 0 TO BOOLEAN
--------------------------------
  bool(0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts the integer 0 to boolean:
• bool → The bool() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 0 → The integer value zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python sees the bool() function
2. Python takes the integer: 0
3. Python converts 0 to boolean: False
4. Python returns: False

THE RESULT:
The output will be: False (type: bool)

TYPE CHECKING:
  type(bool(0))   # Returns: <class 'bool'>

VERIFICATION:
  bool(0) == False  # Returns: True

EXAMPLE 2: FLOAT 0.0 TO BOOLEAN
--------------------------------
  bool(0.0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This converts the float 0.0 to boolean:
• bool → The bool() function
• ( → Opening parenthesis
• 0.0 → The float value zero point zero
• ) → Closing parenthesis

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. Python takes the float: 0.0
2. Python converts 0.0 to boolean: False
3. Python returns: False

THE RESULT:
The output will be: False (type: bool)

VERIFICATION:
  bool(0.0) == False  # Returns: True

OTHER NUMBER TO BOOLEAN CONVERSIONS
------------------------------------
While 1→True and 0→False are the most common, any non-zero number becomes True:

EXAMPLE 1: POSITIVE NUMBERS
----------------------------
  bool(5)        # Returns: True (non-zero)
  bool(100)      # Returns: True (non-zero)
  bool(3.14)     # Returns: True (non-zero)
  bool(0.1)      # Returns: True (non-zero, even small)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
All non-zero numbers become True:
• bool(5) → True (5 is not zero)
• bool(100) → True (100 is not zero)
• bool(3.14) → True (3.14 is not zero)
• bool(0.1) → True (0.1 is not zero, even though small)

THE RULE:
Any number that is not exactly 0 or 0.0 becomes True.

EXAMPLE 2: NEGATIVE NUMBERS
----------------------------
  bool(-1)       # Returns: True (non-zero)
  bool(-100)     # Returns: True (non-zero)
  bool(-3.14)    # Returns: True (non-zero)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
Negative numbers also become True:
• bool(-1) → True (-1 is not zero)
• bool(-100) → True (-100 is not zero)
• bool(-3.14) → True (-3.14 is not zero)

THE RULE:
The sign doesn't matter - only whether it's zero or not.

SUMMARY OF NUMBER TO BOOLEAN CONVERSION
----------------------------------------
ZERO VALUES (become False):
  bool(0)        # Returns: False
  bool(0.0)      # Returns: False

NON-ZERO VALUES (become True):
  bool(1)        # Returns: True
  bool(1.0)      # Returns: True
  bool(5)        # Returns: True
  bool(-1)       # Returns: True
  bool(0.1)      # Returns: True

THE PATTERN:
• Zero (0 or 0.0) → False
• Any non-zero number → True
• Sign doesn't matter, only whether it's zero

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
------------------
EXAMPLE 1: CHECKING IF COUNT IS NON-ZERO
-----------------------------------------
  count = 5
  has_items = bool(count)  # True (count is non-zero)
  
  if has_items:
      print("There are items")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
This checks if count is non-zero:
• count = 5 → Integer variable
• bool(count) → Converts 5 to True
• has_items → True
• if has_items → Condition is True, so code runs

EXAMPLE 2: SIMPLIFYING CONDITIONS
----------------------------------
Instead of:
  if count > 0:
      print("Has items")

You can use:
  if bool(count):
      print("Has items")

Both work the same way when count is a number.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOOLEANS AND NUMBERS
---------------------------------------------
The conversions work both ways:

BOOLEAN → NUMBER:
  int(True)   → 1
  int(False)  → 0
  float(True) → 1.0
  float(False) → 0.0

NUMBER → BOOLEAN:
  bool(1)     → True
  bool(0)     → False
  bool(1.0)   → True
  bool(0.0)   → False

ROUND-TRIP CONVERSION:
  bool(int(True))   → True (True → 1 → True)
  int(bool(1))      → 1 (1 → True → 1)
