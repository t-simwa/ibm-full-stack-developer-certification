DEFINITION
----------
Let's put together everything we've learned by examining a complete HTML 
document example. This will help you see how all the concepts work together 
in a real-world scenario.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
A complete HTML document brings together all the concepts we've covered: 
DOCTYPE declaration, html root element, head and body sections, various 
tags, and their relationships. Understanding a complete document helps you 
apply your knowledge to real web pages.

RELATIONSHIPS IN THE DOCUMENT
------------------------------
Parent-child relationships:
• <html> is parent of <head> and <body>
• <head> is parent of <meta>, <title>, <link>
• <body> is parent of <h1>, <p>, <div class="player-container">
• <div class="player-container"> is parent of all <div class="player-card">
• Each <div class="player-card"> is parent of <h3> and <p> elements

Sibling relationships:
• <head> and <body> are siblings
• <h1>, <p>, and <div class="player-container"> are siblings
• All <div class="player-card"> are siblings
• <h3>, <p class="salary">, and <p class="team"> are siblings (within each card)

Descendant relationships:
• All elements are descendants of <html>
• <h3>, <p> elements are descendants of <body>
• They're also descendants of their parent <div class="player-card">

HOW TO IDENTIFY SCRAPABLE DATA
-------------------------------
In this document, scrapable data includes:

1. PLAYER NAMES
   • Located in: <h3> tags within <div class="player-card">
   • Examples: "Michael Jordan", "LeBron James", "Stephen Curry"
   • How to find: Look for <h3> tags inside player-card divs

2. SALARIES
   • Located in: <p class="salary"> tags
   • Examples: "Salary: $33,000,000", "Salary: $41,000,000"
   • How to find: Look for <p> tags with class="salary"

3. TEAMS
   • Located in: <p class="team"> tags
   • Examples: "Team: Chicago Bulls", "Team: Los Angeles Lakers"
   • How to find: Look for <p> tags with class="team"

SCRAPING STRATEGY FOR THIS DOCUMENT
-----------------------------------
Based on the HTML structure:

1. Find the container
   • Locate <div class="player-container">
   • This groups all players together

2. Find all player cards
   • Find all <div class="player-card"> elements
   • Each represents one player

3. Extract data from each card
   • For each player-card:
     - Find <h3> → extract player name
     - Find <p class="salary"> → extract salary
     - Find <p class="team"> → extract team

4. Organize the data
   • Create a list of dictionaries
   • Each dictionary represents one player
   • Keys: "name", "salary", "team"

This structure makes scraping straightforward because:
• Data is well-organized
• Classes help identify elements
• Pattern is consistent
• Relationships are clear

================================================================================

SECTION 3.2: IDENTIFYING DATA STRUCTURE IN HTML
------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Before you can scrape data, you need to identify how the data is structured 
in the HTML. This involves understanding which tags contain your target data, 
what attributes help identify elements, and how elements relate to each other.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Identifying data structure is the first step in web scraping. You need to 
examine the HTML to understand where your target data is located, how it's 
organized, and what patterns you can use to extract it reliably.

THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------
Step-by-step process:

1. INSPECT THE WEB PAGE
   • Open the page in a browser
   • Right-click on the data you want
   • Select "Inspect" to see HTML

2. IDENTIFY THE CONTAINER
   • Find the element that contains all your target data
   • Look for divs, sections, or other containers
   • Check for class or id attributes

3. IDENTIFY THE PATTERN
   • Look for repeating patterns
   • Each item might be in its own container
   • Identify what makes each item unique

4. IDENTIFY THE DATA ELEMENTS
   • Find which tags contain each piece of data
   • Check for classes or ids that identify elements
   • Understand the relationship between elements

5. VERIFY THE PATTERN
   • Check multiple items
   • Ensure the pattern is consistent
   • Identify any variations or edge cases

EXAMPLE: IDENTIFYING PLAYER DATA STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------
Let's say you see this on a web page:

  Player: Michael Jordan
  Salary: $33,000,000
  Team: Chicago Bulls

  Player: LeBron James
  Salary: $41,000,000
  Team: Los Angeles Lakers

Step 1: Inspect the HTML
  Right-click on "Michael Jordan" → Inspect

Step 2: See the HTML structure
  <div class="player">
    <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
    <p>Team: Chicago Bulls</p>
  </div>

Step 3: Identify the container
  • Container: <div class="player">
  • This wraps each player's information

Step 4: Identify the pattern
  • Each player is in a <div class="player">
  • Name is in <h3>
  • Salary is in first <p>
  • Team is in second <p>

Step 5: Verify with another player
  <div class="player">
    <h3>LeBron James</h3>
    <p>Salary: $41,000,000</p>
    <p>Team: Los Angeles Lakers</p>
  </div>
  • Pattern is consistent!
  • Same structure for all players

COMMON STRUCTURAL PATTERNS
---------------------------
Here are common patterns you'll encounter:

1. LIST PATTERN
   <ul>
     <li>Item 1</li>
     <li>Item 2</li>
     <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   • Container: <ul> or <ol>
   • Items: <li> elements
   • Pattern: Each <li> is one item

2. CARD PATTERN
   <div class="card">
     <h3>Title</h3>
     <p>Description</p>
   </div>
   • Container: <div class="card">
   • Pattern: Each card is one item
   • Data in nested elements

3. TABLE PATTERN
   <table>
     <tr>
       <td>Data 1</td>
       <td>Data 2</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   • Container: <table>
   • Items: <tr> (rows)
   • Data: <td> (cells)

4. NESTED DIV PATTERN
   <div class="container">
     <div class="item">Item 1</div>
     <div class="item">Item 2</div>
   </div>
   • Container: outer <div>
   • Items: inner <div> elements
   • Pattern: Nested structure

USING ATTRIBUTES TO IDENTIFY ELEMENTS
---------------------------------------
Attributes help identify elements:

1. CLASS ATTRIBUTES
   <div class="player-card">
   • Groups similar elements
   • Can have multiple classes
   • Very useful for targeting

2. ID ATTRIBUTES
   <div id="main-content">
   • Unique identifier
   • Only one per page
   • Great for finding specific elements

3. DATA ATTRIBUTES
   <div data-player-id="123">
   • Custom data storage
   • Often contains useful information
   • Can be used for identification

EXAMPLE: USING CLASSES TO IDENTIFY DATA
-----------------------------------------
Given this HTML:

  <div class="player-card">
    <h3 class="player-name">Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p class="player-salary">$33,000,000</p>
    <p class="player-team">Chicago Bulls</p>
  </div>

Identification strategy:
• Find all elements with class="player-card"
• Within each, find:
  - <h3 class="player-name"> → name
  - <p class="player-salary"> → salary
  - <p class="player-team"> → team

This is very reliable because:
• Classes clearly identify elements
• Less dependent on tag order
• More resilient to HTML changes

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENT RELATIONSHIPS
------------------------------------
Relationships help you navigate:

1. PARENT-CHILD
   • Find parent, then get children
   • "Get all <p> children of this <div>"

2. SIBLING
   • Find element, then get next/previous sibling
   • "Get the <p> that follows this <h3>"

3. DESCENDANT
   • Find container, then get all descendants
   • "Get all <p> anywhere in this <div>"

EXAMPLE: USING RELATIONSHIPS
-----------------------------
Given:

  <div class="player">
    <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
  </div>

Using relationships:
• Find <div class="player"> (container)
• Get its child <h3> → name
• Get its child <p> → salary
• They're siblings, so you can navigate between them

[END SECTION 3.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 3.3: PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: BASKETBALL PLAYERS PAGE
---------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Let's work through a complete practical example using the basketball players 
scenario mentioned in the original material. This will demonstrate how all 
the HTML concepts come together for web scraping.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
This practical example will show you step-by-step how to analyze HTML 
structure and identify how to extract player names and salaries. We'll use 
the exact scenario from the original material: finding the name and salary of 
players in a National Basketball League from a web page.

THE SCENARIO
------------
You were asked to find the name and salary of players in a National 
Basketball League from a web page.

THE HTML STRUCTURE
------------------
Here's what the HTML might look like:

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>NBA Player Information</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
      <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
      
      <h3>LeBron James</h3>
      <p>Salary: $41,000,000</p>
      
      <h3>Stephen Curry</h3>
      <p>Salary: $51,000,000</p>
    </body>
  </html>

STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS
---------------------
Step 1: Understand the Document Structure
  • DOCTYPE: HTML5 document
  • Root: <html>
  • Head: Contains title (not our target)
  • Body: Contains the data we want

Step 2: Identify Where Data Is Located
  • All data is in the <body> element
  • This is what's displayed on the web page
  • Head contains meta information, not our data

Step 3: Identify the Data Structure
  • Player names are in <h3> tags
  • Salaries are in <p> tags
  • They appear in pairs: h3 followed by p

Step 4: Identify the Pattern
  • Pattern repeats for each player:
    <h3>Player Name</h3>
    <p>Salary: $Amount</p>
  • Each player follows the same structure
  • Consistent pattern makes extraction easier

Step 5: Understand Relationships
  • <h3> and <p> are siblings (same parent: <body>)
  • Each <h3> is followed by a <p>
  • They're related data (name and salary)

HOW TO EXTRACT THE DATA
------------------------
Based on the HTML structure:

Method 1: Extract by Tag Type
  1. Find all <h3> elements → get player names
  2. Find all <p> elements → get salaries
  3. Match them up by position

Method 2: Extract Using Sibling Relationships
  1. Find all <h3> elements
  2. For each <h3>, get its next sibling <p>
  3. Extract name from <h3>, salary from <p>

Method 3: Extract Using Pattern
  1. Find the <body> element
  2. Get all its children
  3. Process in pairs: h3 (name) + p (salary)

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
Here's how the data is organized:

  <body>
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ <h3>Michael Jordan</h3> │ ← Player 1 Name
    │ <p>Salary: $33M</p>     │ ← Player 1 Salary
    └─────────────────────────┘
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ <h3>LeBron James</h3>    │ ← Player 2 Name
    │ <p>Salary: $41M</p>      │ ← Player 2 Salary
    └─────────────────────────┘
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ <h3>Stephen Curry</h3>   │ ← Player 3 Name
    │ <p>Salary: $51M</p>      │ ← Player 3 Salary
    └─────────────────────────┘
  </body>

EXTRACTED DATA STRUCTURE
-------------------------
After extraction, you'd have:

Players:
1. Name: "Michael Jordan"
   Salary: "Salary: $33,000,000"

2. Name: "LeBron James"
   Salary: "Salary: $41,000,000"

3. Name: "Stephen Curry"
   Salary: "Salary: $51,000,000"

You might clean this up to:
[
  {"name": "Michael Jordan", "salary": "$33,000,000"},
  {"name": "LeBron James", "salary": "$41,000,000"},
  {"name": "Stephen Curry", "salary": "$51,000,000"}
]

KEY OBSERVATIONS
----------------
From this example, we can observe:

1. DATA IS IN THE BODY
   • All scrapable data is in <body>
   • Head contains metadata, not our target

2. TAGS STRUCTURE THE DATA
   • <h3> contains names
   • <p> contains salaries
   • Tags organize the information

3. PATTERN IS CONSISTENT
   • Same structure for each player
   • Makes extraction predictable
   • Can write code to handle all players

4. RELATIONSHIPS MATTER
   • <h3> and <p> are siblings
   • They're related (name and salary)
   • Understanding relationships helps extraction

5. CONTENT IS IN TAGS
   • "Michael Jordan" is content of <h3>
   • "Salary: $33,000,000" is content of <p>
   • Extract content, not the tags themselves

VARIATIONS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER
-------------------------------
Real pages might have variations:

Variation 1: With Classes
  <h3 class="player-name">Michael Jordan</h3>
  <p class="player-salary">Salary: $33,000,000</p>
  • Classes make identification easier
  • More reliable than just tag names

Variation 2: In Containers
  <div class="player">
    <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
  </div>
  • Each player in its own container
  • Can extract each container separately

Variation 3: In a Table
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Michael Jordan</td>
      <td>$33,000,000</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  • Table structure
  • Extract row by row
  • Each cell is a piece of data

ADAPTING YOUR APPROACH
----------------------
Regardless of variation:
• Identify the structure first
• Find the pattern
• Adapt your extraction method
• Test with multiple items

The HTML concepts you've learned apply to all variations - you just need to 
identify the specific structure and adapt your approach accordingly.

[END SECTION 3.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 3.4: PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: HTML TABLE STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Let's examine a practical example using HTML tables. Tables are a very 
common way to display structured data on web pages, and understanding how to 
extract data from tables is essential for web scraping.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
HTML tables organize data in rows and columns, making them ideal for 
structured data like player statistics, product listings, or financial data. 
Understanding table structure helps you extract this data systematically.

COMPLETE TABLE EXAMPLE
----------------------
Here's a complete table with player information:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Player Name</th>
      <th>Salary</th>
      <th>Team</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Michael Jordan</td>
      <td>$33,000,000</td>
      <td>Chicago Bulls</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LeBron James</td>
      <td>$41,000,000</td>
      <td>Los Angeles Lakers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stephen Curry</td>
      <td>$51,000,000</td>
      <td>Golden State Warriors</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
This creates a table that looks like:

  ┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────────┐
  │ Player Name     │ Salary       │ Team                 │
  ├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────────┤
  │ Michael Jordan  │ $33,000,000  │ Chicago Bulls        │
  │ LeBron James    │ $41,000,000  │ Los Angeles Lakers   │
  │ Stephen Curry   │ $51,000,000  │ Golden State Warriors│
  └─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────────┘

STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN
-------------------
Level 1: <table>
  • Container for entire table
  • Wraps all rows

Level 2: <tr> (Table Rows)
  • Row 1: Headers (<th> elements)
  • Row 2: Data (<td> elements) - Michael Jordan
  • Row 3: Data (<td> elements) - LeBron James
  • Row 4: Data (<td> elements) - Stephen Curry

Level 3: <th> or <td> (Cells)
  • <th> in first row: Column headers
  • <td> in other rows: Data cells

TREE STRUCTURE
--------------
        <table>
       /   |   |   \
     <tr> <tr> <tr> <tr>  (4 rows)
      |    |    |    |
    <th> <td> <td> <td>  (3 cells per row)
    <th> <td> <td> <td>
    <th> <td> <td> <td>

RELATIONSHIPS
-------------
Parent-child:
• <table> is parent of all <tr>
• Each <tr> is parent of its <th> or <td> cells

Siblings:
• All <tr> are siblings
• All <td> in a row are siblings
• All <th> in header row are siblings

HOW TO EXTRACT DATA FROM THIS TABLE
------------------------------------
Step-by-step extraction process:

Step 1: Find the Table
  • Locate <table> element
  • This contains all the data

Step 2: Extract Headers (Optional)
  • Find first <tr>
  • Extract text from all <th> elements
  • Result: ["Player Name", "Salary", "Team"]

Step 3: Extract Data Rows
  • Find all <tr> elements (skip first if it's headers)
  • For each <tr>:
    - Find all <td> elements
    - Extract text from each <td>

Step 4: Organize Data
  • Match cells to headers
  • Create structured output

EXTRACTION RESULTS
------------------
After extraction:

Headers: ["Player Name", "Salary", "Team"]

Rows:
1. ["Michael Jordan", "$33,000,000", "Chicago Bulls"]
2. ["LeBron James", "$41,000,000", "Los Angeles Lakers"]
3. ["Stephen Curry", "$51,000,000", "Golden State Warriors"]

Structured output:
[
  {
    "Player Name": "Michael Jordan",
    "Salary": "$33,000,000",
    "Team": "Chicago Bulls"
  },
  {
    "Player Name": "LeBron James",
    "Salary": "$41,000,000",
    "Team": "Los Angeles Lakers"
  },
  {
    "Player Name": "Stephen Curry",
    "Salary": "$51,000,000",
    "Team": "Golden State Warriors"
  }
]

WHY TABLES ARE GOOD FOR SCRAPING
---------------------------------
Tables are excellent for scraping because:

1. CLEAR STRUCTURE
   • Data is organized in rows and columns
   • Structure is predictable
   • Easy to navigate

2. CONSISTENT PATTERN
   • Each row follows same structure
   • Same number of columns
   • Pattern is reliable

3. HEADERS PROVIDE CONTEXT
   • Headers tell you what each column is
   • Can use headers as keys
   • Makes data meaningful

4. SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION
   • Extract row by row
   • Extract cell by cell
   • Very methodical process

COMMON TABLE VARIATIONS
------------------------
Real tables might have variations:

Variation 1: Multiple Header Rows
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3">NBA Players</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Salary</th>
    <th>Team</th>
  </tr>
  • Multiple header rows
  • Need to handle accordingly

Variation 2: Row Headers
  <tr>
    <th>Michael Jordan</th>
    <td>$33,000,000</td>
    <td>Chicago Bulls</td>
  </tr>
  • First column is header
  • Rest are data cells

Variation 3: Nested Tables
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <table>...</table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  • Table inside a table
  • Need to handle nesting

ADAPTING TO VARIATIONS
----------------------
Regardless of variation:
• Identify the structure first
• Understand headers vs. data
• Extract systematically
• Handle edge cases

EXAMPLE: PREPARING TO SCRAPE PLAYER DATA
-----------------------------------------
Let's prepare to scrape player data:

Step 1: Inspect
  Right-click on "Michael Jordan" → Inspect
  See: <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>

Step 2: Identify Container
  Look at parent elements
  See: <body> contains all players

Step 3: Identify Items
  Each player is represented by:
  - <h3> with name
  - <p> with salary
  Pattern: h3 followed by p

Step 4: Identify Data Elements
  • Name: <h3> tag
  • Salary: <p> tag
  • They're siblings

Step 5: Verify Pattern
  Check "LeBron James"
  Same structure: <h3> followed by <p>
  Pattern is consistent!

Step 6: Plan Extraction
  • Find all <h3> → get names
  • Find all <p> → get salaries
  • Match by position
  • Or use sibling relationships

DOCUMENTING YOUR FINDINGS
-------------------------
It's helpful to document:

1. PAGE URL
   • Which page are you scraping?
   • Save the URL for reference

2. DATA STRUCTURE
   • Draw the HTML structure
   • Note relationships
   • Document the pattern

3. TARGET ELEMENTS
   • Which tags contain data?
   • What attributes help identify?
   • What's the extraction approach?

4. EDGE CASES
   • Are there variations?
   • Missing data?
   • Special cases to handle?

EXAMPLE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

SECTION 3.7: HOW HTML STRUCTURE RELATES TO PYTHON SCRAPING
------------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Understanding HTML structure directly relates to how you'll use Python 
libraries like BeautifulSoup to extract data. The HTML concepts you've 
learned map directly to methods and techniques in Python scraping libraries.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The HTML structure you understand now will be the foundation for using 
Python scraping libraries. Every HTML concept has a corresponding way to 
access and extract data using Python tools.

MAPPING HTML CONCEPTS TO PYTHON
--------------------------------
Here's how HTML concepts map to Python:

1. HTML DOCUMENT → BeautifulSoup Object
   HTML:
     <html>...</html>
   
   Python:
     soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
     # soup represents the entire HTML document

2. FINDING ELEMENTS BY TAG NAME
   HTML:
     <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
   
   Python:
     headings = soup.find_all('h3')
     # Finds all <h3> elements

3. FINDING ELEMENTS BY CLASS
   HTML:
     <div class="player-card">
   
   Python:
     cards = soup.find_all('div', class_='player-card')
     # Finds all divs with class="player-card"

4. FINDING ELEMENTS BY ID
   HTML:
     <div id="main-content">
   
   Python:
     main = soup.find('div', id='main-content')
     # Finds div with id="main-content"

5. GETTING TEXT CONTENT
   HTML:
     <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
   
   Python:
     name = heading.get_text()
     # Gets "Michael Jordan"

6. NAVIGATING PARENT-CHILD
   HTML:
     <div>
       <h3>Title</h3>
     </div>
   
   Python:
     parent = heading.parent
     child = parent.find('h3')
     # Navigate relationships

7. FINDING SIBLINGS
   HTML:
     <h3>Name</h3>
     <p>Salary</p>
   
   Python:
     next_sibling = heading.find_next_sibling('p')
     # Gets the next <p> sibling

8. EXTRACTING ATTRIBUTES
   HTML:
     <a href="https://example.com">
   
   Python:
     url = link.get('href')
     # Gets "https://example.com"

EXAMPLE: COMPLETE PYTHON SCRAPING CODE
----------------------------------------
Given this HTML:

  <body>
    <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
    <h3>LeBron James</h3>
    <p>Salary: $41,000,000</p>
  </body>

Python code to extract:

  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  
  html = """
  <body>
    <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
    <p>Salary: $33,000,000</p>
    <h3>LeBron James</h3>
    <p>Salary: $41,000,000</p>
  </body>
  """
  
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
  
  # Find all headings
  headings = soup.find_all('h3')
  
  # Find all paragraphs
  paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
  
  # Extract data
  players = []
  for i in range(len(headings)):
      name = headings[i].get_text()
      salary = paragraphs[i].get_text()
      players.append({'name': name, 'salary': salary})

HOW HTML KNOWLEDGE HELPS
-------------------------
Your HTML knowledge helps you:

1. UNDERSTAND WHAT TO FIND
   • Know which tags contain data
   • Understand structure
   • Identify target elements

2. WRITE BETTER SELECTORS
   • Use appropriate methods
   • Navigate relationships
   • Handle structure correctly

3. DEBUG EFFECTIVELY
   • Understand why code fails
   • Identify structure issues
   • Fix problems quickly

4. ADAPT TO CHANGES
   • Understand HTML changes
   • Adapt code accordingly
   • Handle variations

THE CONNECTION
--------------
HTML Structure → Python Code:
• Tags → find_all('tag')
• Classes → class_='classname'
• IDs → id='idname'
• Content → get_text()
• Attributes → get('attr')
• Parents → .parent
• Children → .find_all()
• Siblings → .find_next_sibling()

Every HTML concept you've learned has a Python equivalent!
