CONDITIONS AND BRANCHING IN PYTHON
Comprehensive Study Guide - Part 2
================================================================================

WELCOME TO PART 2
-----------------
Welcome to Part 2 of Conditions and Branching in Python. This part focuses 
on conditional statements that allow your programs to make decisions and 
execute different code based on different conditions.

ESTIMATED TIME NEEDED
---------------------
5 minutes (for basic reading)
90-120 minutes (for comprehensive study with practice)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-------------------
After studying this guide, you will be able to:
• Understand what branching means in programming
• Use if statements to execute code conditionally
• Use else statements to handle alternative cases
• Use elif statements to check multiple conditions
• Understand indentation and code blocks in Python
• Write complex conditional logic with nested statements
• Apply conditional statements to real-world problems

OVERVIEW
--------
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs. It's 
the foundation of decision-making in programming. Without branching, programs 
would execute the same code every time, regardless of the data or situation.

Python provides three main conditional statements:
1. if - executes code when a condition is True
2. else - executes code when the if condition is False
3. elif - checks additional conditions when previous conditions are False

These statements work together to create flexible, responsive programs that 
can adapt to different situations and data.

PART 2: CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS (BRANCHING)
================================================================================

SECTION 2.1: WHAT IS BRANCHING?
--------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs. It 
enables programs to make decisions and execute different code paths based on 
conditions.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
In programming, branching is like a fork in the road. When your program 
reaches a decision point, it evaluates a condition and chooses which path 
to take. This allows programs to:
• Respond differently to different inputs
• Handle various scenarios appropriately
• Make decisions based on data
• Control program flow dynamically

Without branching, programs would be linear and inflexible - they would 
always execute the same code in the same order, regardless of the situation.

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of branching like a security checkpoint:
• If you have a valid ID (condition is True), you can enter (execute code A)
• If you don't have a valid ID (condition is False), you cannot enter 
  (execute code B or skip)

Or like a traffic light:
• If the light is green (condition is True), you can go (execute code A)
• If the light is red (condition is False), you must stop (execute code B)

KEY CONCEPTS
------------
1. CONDITION: A Boolean expression that evaluates to True or False
2. BRANCH: A path of code that executes based on a condition
3. EXECUTION FLOW: The order in which code runs
4. DECISION POINT: Where the program evaluates a condition

WHY IS BRANCHING IMPORTANT?
---------------------------
Branching is essential because:
1. Programs need to respond to different situations
2. User input varies and needs different handling
3. Data validation requires conditional logic
4. Business rules often depend on conditions
5. Error handling requires conditional responses

EXAMPLE: SIMPLE BRANCHING CONCEPT
----------------------------------
  # Without branching (always executes the same code)
  print("Hello")
  print("World")
  # This always prints "Hello" then "World", no matter what
  
  # With branching (executes different code based on condition)
  user_name = "Alice"
  if user_name == "Alice":
      print("Hello, Alice!")
  else:
      print("Hello, stranger!")
  # This prints different messages based on the user_name value

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Lines 1-3: Without branching example
        • These lines always execute in the same way
        • No decision-making, no variation

Lines 4-5: (blank lines for readability)

Lines 6-10: With branching example
        • Line 6: user_name = "Alice"
          - Stores "Alice" in variable user_name
        • Line 7: if user_name == "Alice":
          - Checks if user_name equals "Alice"
          - Since it does, the condition is True
        • Line 8:     print("Hello, Alice!")
          - This code executes because the condition is True
          - Indented code belongs to the if block
        • Line 9: else:
          - Alternative path if the condition was False
          - Not executed in this case
        • Line 10:     print("Hello, stranger!")
          - This code would execute if the condition was False
          - Not executed in this example

[END SECTION 2.1]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.2: THE IF STATEMENT
------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The if statement executes a block of code only when a condition is True. 
If the condition is False, the code block is skipped, and execution continues 
with the code after the if statement.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The if statement is the most fundamental conditional statement in Python. 
It allows you to execute code conditionally - only when a specific condition 
is met. Think of it as a locked room: if the statement is True, you can 
enter the room and execute the predefined task. If the statement is False, 
your program skips the task and moves on.

SYNTAX
------
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if condition is True
      statement1
      statement2
      # More statements...

KEY COMPONENTS
--------------
1. if - The keyword that starts the conditional statement
2. condition - A Boolean expression (evaluates to True or False)
3. : (colon) - Required punctuation that indicates the start of the code block
4. Indented code block - The code that executes when condition is True
5. Statements after if - Code that runs regardless of the condition

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: THE CONCERT EXAMPLE
----------------------------------------
Consider a blue rectangle representing an AC/DC concert. If an individual is 
18 or older, they can enter the AC/DC concert. If they are under the age of 
18, they cannot enter the concert.

Scenario 1: Individual is 17 years old
• They proceed to the concert
• Their age is 17
• Condition (age >= 18) is False
• They are not granted access to the concert
• They must move on

Scenario 2: Individual is 19 years old
• They proceed to the concert
• Their age is 19
• Condition (age >= 18) is True
• They can enter the concert
• Then they can move on

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC IF STATEMENT
------------------------------
  # Set the age
  age = 17
  
  # Check if age is 18 or older
  if age >= 18:
      print("You will enter.")
  
  # This code runs regardless of the condition
  print("Move on.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Set the age
        • Comment explaining what we're doing

Line 2: age = 17
        • Creates variable 'age' and assigns 17 to it
        • This represents the individual's age

Line 3: (blank line for readability)

Line 4: # Check if age is 18 or older
        • Comment explaining the condition

Line 5: if age >= 18:
        • if - Keyword that starts the conditional statement
        • age >= 18 - Condition being evaluated
          - Checks if age (17) is greater than or equal to 18
          - 17 >= 18 evaluates to False
        • : - Colon indicates the start of the code block
        • Since the condition is False, the indented code is skipped

Line 6:     print("You will enter.")
        • Four spaces of indentation (this is the code block)
        • This code belongs to the if statement
        • It only executes if age >= 18 is True
        • Since the condition is False, this line is SKIPPED
        • Nothing is printed from this line

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: # This code runs regardless of the condition
        • Comment explaining that this code always runs

Line 9: print("Move on.")
        • This line is NOT indented, so it's outside the if block
        • It executes regardless of whether the condition was True or False
        • Output: Move on.

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python assigns 17 to the variable age
2. Python evaluates the condition: age >= 18
   • Looks at age (which is 17)
   • Compares: Is 17 >= 18? → No, so the result is False
3. Since the condition is False, Python skips the indented code block
   • The print("You will enter.") line is NOT executed
4. Python continues to the next line (print("Move on."))
5. Python executes print("Move on.") and displays: Move on.

EXAMPLE 2: IF STATEMENT WITH TRUE CONDITION
--------------------------------------------
  # Set the age to 19
  age = 19
  
  # Check if age is 18 or older
  if age >= 18:
      print("You will enter.")
  
  # This code runs regardless of the condition
  print("Move on.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Set the age to 19
        • Comment

Line 2: age = 19
        • Creates variable 'age' and assigns 19 to it

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check if age is 18 or older
        • Comment

Line 5: if age >= 18:
        • if - Conditional statement keyword
        • age >= 18 - Condition: Is 19 >= 18?
        • 19 >= 18 evaluates to True
        • : - Colon starts the code block
        • Since the condition is True, the indented code WILL execute

Line 6:     print("You will enter.")
        • Four spaces of indentation (part of the if block)
        • Since the condition is True, this line EXECUTES
        • Output: You will enter.

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: # This code runs regardless of the condition
        • Comment

Line 9: print("Move on.")
        • Not indented, so it's outside the if block
        • Always executes
        • Output: Move on.

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python assigns 19 to the variable age
2. Python evaluates the condition: age >= 18
   • Looks at age (which is 19)
   • Compares: Is 19 >= 18? → Yes, so the result is True
3. Since the condition is True, Python executes the indented code block
   • The print("You will enter.") line IS executed
   • Output: You will enter.
4. Python continues to the next line (print("Move on."))
5. Python executes print("Move on.") and displays: Move on.

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
You will enter.
Move on.

EXAMPLE 3: IF STATEMENT WITH MULTIPLE STATEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------
  # Temperature check example
  temperature = 85
  
  if temperature > 80:
      print("It's hot outside!")
      print("Remember to stay hydrated.")
      print("Consider wearing light clothing.")
  
  print("Have a great day!")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Temperature check example
        • Comment

Line 2: temperature = 85
        • Stores 85 in variable temperature

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: if temperature > 80:
        • Checks if temperature (85) is greater than 80
        • 85 > 80 evaluates to True
        • Since True, the indented block will execute

Line 5:     print("It's hot outside!")
        • Indented, so part of the if block
        • Executes because condition is True
        • Output: It's hot outside!

Line 6:     print("Remember to stay hydrated.")
        • Also indented, part of the if block
        • Executes because condition is True
        • Output: Remember to stay hydrated.

Line 7:     print("Consider wearing light clothing.")
        • Also indented, part of the if block
        • Executes because condition is True
        • Output: Consider wearing light clothing.

Line 8: (blank line)

Line 9: print("Have a great day!")
        • Not indented, so outside the if block
        • Always executes regardless of condition
        • Output: Have a great day!

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
It's hot outside!
Remember to stay hydrated.
Consider wearing light clothing.
Have a great day!

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT IF STATEMENTS
------------------------------------
1. The condition must evaluate to a Boolean value (True or False)
2. The colon (:) after the condition is REQUIRED
3. The code block must be indented (typically 4 spaces)
4. All statements in the block must have the same indentation
5. Code after the if block (not indented) always executes

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
------------------------
1. Forgetting the colon (:)
   Wrong: if age >= 18
   Right: if age >= 18:

2. Incorrect indentation
   Wrong: if age >= 18:
   print("You will enter.")  # Not indented!
   Right: if age >= 18:
       print("You will enter.")  # Properly indented

3. Using = instead of == in conditions
   Wrong: if age = 18:  # This assigns, doesn't compare!
   Right: if age == 18:  # This compares

[END SECTION 2.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.3: UNDERSTANDING INDENTATION AND CODE BLOCKS
--------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Indentation in Python is used to define code blocks. Unlike many programming 
languages that use braces {} or keywords, Python uses indentation to group 
statements together.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
In Python, indentation is not just for readability - it's part of the syntax. 
The amount of indentation determines which statements belong to which code 
block. This is crucial for conditional statements, loops, and functions.

HOW INDENTATION WORKS
---------------------
• Python uses whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of lines
• All statements at the same indentation level belong to the same block
• Indented code belongs to the statement above it
• The standard is 4 spaces per indentation level
• Mixing spaces and tabs can cause errors

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of indentation like an outline or hierarchy:
• Level 0 (no indent): Main topics
• Level 1 (4 spaces): Subtopics under main topics
• Level 2 (8 spaces): Sub-subtopics under subtopics

In code:
• Level 0: Main program flow
• Level 1: Code blocks (if, else, functions)
• Level 2: Nested code blocks

EXAMPLE 1: CORRECT INDENTATION
--------------------------------
  age = 19
  
  if age >= 18:
      print("You can vote!")
      print("You can drive!")
      print("You are an adult!")
  
  print("This always runs.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: age = 19
        • No indentation - main program level
        • This line always executes

Line 2: (blank line)

Line 3: if age >= 18:
        • No indentation - main program level
        • Starts the if statement

Line 4:     print("You can vote!")
        • 4 spaces indentation - belongs to the if block
        • Only executes if condition is True

Line 5:     print("You can drive!")
        • 4 spaces indentation - same level as line 4
        • Also belongs to the if block
        • Only executes if condition is True

Line 6:     print("You are an adult!")
        • 4 spaces indentation - same level as lines 4-5
        • Also belongs to the if block
        • Only executes if condition is True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: print("This always runs.")
        • No indentation - back to main program level
        • Always executes regardless of condition

VISUAL REPRESENTATION:
---------------------
age = 19                    ← Level 0 (no indent)

if age >= 18:               ← Level 0 (no indent)
    print("...")            ← Level 1 (4 spaces) - belongs to if
    print("...")            ← Level 1 (4 spaces) - belongs to if
    print("...")            ← Level 1 (4 spaces) - belongs to if

print("...")                ← Level 0 (no indent) - always runs

EXAMPLE 2: INCORRECT INDENTATION (ERROR)
-----------------------------------------
  age = 19
  
  if age >= 18:
  print("You can vote!")  # ERROR: This line is not indented!
  
  print("This always runs.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: age = 19
        • Valid code

Line 2: (blank line)

Line 3: if age >= 18:
        • Valid - starts if statement

Line 4: print("You can vote!")
        • ERROR: This line has no indentation
        • Python expects indented code after the colon
        • This will cause an IndentationError

ERROR MESSAGE:
--------------
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 3

CORRECTED VERSION:
------------------
  age = 19
  
  if age >= 18:
      print("You can vote!")  # Now properly indented
  
  print("This always runs.")

EXAMPLE 3: NESTED INDENTATION
------------------------------
  age = 20
  has_license = True
  
  if age >= 18:
      print("You are an adult.")
      if has_license:
          print("You can drive!")
          print("Drive safely!")
      print("This is still in the outer if block.")
  
  print("This is outside all if blocks.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: age = 20
        • Level 0 - main program

Line 2: has_license = True
        • Level 0 - main program

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: if age >= 18:
        • Level 0 - starts outer if statement

Line 5:     print("You are an adult.")
        • Level 1 (4 spaces) - belongs to outer if block
        • Executes if age >= 18 is True

Line 6:     if has_license:
        • Level 1 (4 spaces) - still in outer if block
        • Starts nested (inner) if statement

Line 7:         print("You can drive!")
        • Level 2 (8 spaces) - belongs to inner if block
        • Executes if BOTH conditions are True:
          - age >= 18 is True AND
          - has_license is True

Line 8:         print("Drive safely!")
        • Level 2 (8 spaces) - also belongs to inner if block
        • Same condition as line 7

Line 9:     print("This is still in the outer if block.")
        • Level 1 (4 spaces) - back to outer if block level
        • Executes if age >= 18 is True (regardless of has_license)

Line 10: (blank line)

Line 11: print("This is outside all if blocks.")
         • Level 0 (no indent) - main program level
         • Always executes

VISUAL REPRESENTATION:
---------------------
age = 20                    ← Level 0
has_license = True          ← Level 0

if age >= 18:               ← Level 0
    print("...")           ← Level 1 (outer if block)
    if has_license:         ← Level 1 (outer if block)
        print("...")       ← Level 2 (inner if block)
        print("...")       ← Level 2 (inner if block)
    print("...")           ← Level 1 (outer if block)

print("...")               ← Level 0 (always runs)

EXECUTION FLOW:
--------------
1. age = 20, has_license = True
2. Check: age >= 18? → Yes (20 >= 18 is True)
3. Execute outer if block:
   • Print "You are an adult."
   • Check: has_license? → Yes (True)
   • Execute inner if block:
     - Print "You can drive!"
     - Print "Drive safely!"
   • Print "This is still in the outer if block."
4. Print "This is outside all if blocks."

OUTPUT:
-------
You are an adult.
You can drive!
Drive safely!
This is still in the outer if block.
This is outside all if blocks.

BEST PRACTICES FOR INDENTATION
-------------------------------
1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level (Python standard)
2. Be consistent - don't mix spaces and tabs
3. Most editors can convert tabs to spaces automatically
4. Use your editor's "show whitespace" feature to see indentation
5. When in doubt, count the spaces at the beginning of the line

COMMON INDENTATION ERRORS
-------------------------
1. Inconsistent indentation (mixing 2, 4, 8 spaces)
2. Forgetting to indent code after a colon
3. Indenting code that shouldn't be indented
4. Mixing tabs and spaces (use spaces only!)

[END SECTION 2.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.4: THE ELSE STATEMENT
---------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The else statement runs a different block of code if the if condition is 
False. It provides an alternative path when the condition is not met.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The else statement is always paired with an if statement. It executes its 
code block when the if condition evaluates to False. Think of it as the 
"otherwise" or "if not" option - if the if condition isn't true, then do 
this instead.

SYNTAX
------
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if condition is True
      statement1
  else:
      # Code to execute if condition is False
      statement2

KEY COMPONENTS
--------------
1. else - The keyword that starts the alternative block
2. : (colon) - Required punctuation
3. Indented code block - Code that executes when if condition is False
4. Must be paired with an if statement (cannot stand alone)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: THE CONCERT EXAMPLE EXTENDED
------------------------------------------------
Let's use the ACDC concert analogy again, but now with an alternative option:

If the user is 17, they cannot go to the ACDC concert (represented by the 
blue rectangle). But they can go to the Meatloaf concert (represented by 
the purple square).

If the individual is 19, the condition is True. They can enter the ACDC 
concert. Then they can move on as before.

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC IF-ELSE STATEMENT
------------------------------------
  # Set the age
  age = 17
  
  # Check if age is 18 or older
  if age >= 18:
      print("You will enter.")
  else:
      print("Go see Meatloaf.")
  
  print("Move on.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Set the age
        • Comment

Line 2: age = 17
        • Stores 17 in variable age

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check if age is 18 or older
        • Comment

Line 5: if age >= 18:
        • Checks if age (17) is >= 18
        • 17 >= 18 evaluates to False
        • Since False, the if block is skipped

Line 6:     print("You will enter.")
        • Indented - belongs to if block
        • NOT executed because condition is False

Line 7: else:
        • else keyword - alternative path
        • : - Colon starts the else block
        • Since if condition was False, this block WILL execute

Line 8:     print("Go see Meatloaf.")
        • Indented - belongs to else block
        • EXECUTES because if condition was False
        • Output: Go see Meatloaf.

Line 9: (blank line)

Line 10: print("Move on.")
         • Not indented - outside both if and else blocks
         • Always executes
         • Output: Move on.

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python assigns 17 to age
2. Python evaluates: age >= 18
   • 17 >= 18 → False
3. Since condition is False:
   • Skip the if block (print("You will enter.") is NOT executed)
   • Execute the else block (print("Go see Meatloaf.") IS executed)
4. Continue to next line: print("Move on.")
5. Execute and display: Move on.

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
Go see Meatloaf.
Move on.

EXAMPLE 2: IF-ELSE WITH TRUE CONDITION
---------------------------------------
  # Set the age to 19
  age = 19
  
  # Check if age is 18 or older
  if age >= 18:
      print("You will enter.")
  else:

Line 1: # Set the age to 19
        • Comment

Line 2: age = 19
        • Stores 19 in variable age

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check if age is 18 or older
        • Comment

Line 5: if age >= 18:
        • Checks if age (19) is >= 18
        • 19 >= 18 evaluates to True
        • Since True, the if block WILL execute

Line 6:     print("You will enter.")
        • Indented - belongs to if block
        • EXECUTES because condition is True
        • Output: You will enter.

Line 7: else:
        • else keyword - alternative path
        • Since if condition was True, this block is SKIPPED

Line 8:     print("Go see Meatloaf.")
        • Indented - belongs to else block
        • NOT executed because if condition was True

Line 9: (blank line)

Line 10: print("Move on.")
         • Not indented - always executes
         • Output: Move on.

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python assigns 19 to age
2. Python evaluates: age >= 18
   • 19 >= 18 → True
3. Since condition is True:
   • Execute the if block (print("You will enter.") IS executed)
   • Skip the else block (print("Go see Meatloaf.") is NOT executed)
4. Continue to next line: print("Move on.")
5. Execute and display: Move on.

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
You will enter.
Move on.

        • Alternative path
        • WILL execute because if condition was False

Line 10-12: (else block statements)
         • All execute because condition was False
         • Output:
           Password is too short.
           Password must be at least 8 characters.
           Please try again.

Line 13: (blank line)

Line 14: print("Thank you for using our service.")

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
Password is too short.
Password must be at least 8 characters.
Please try again.
Thank you for using our service.

KEY POINTS ABOUT ELSE STATEMENTS
--------------------------------
1. else must be paired with an if statement (cannot stand alone)
2. else doesn't have its own condition - it executes when if is False
3. Only one else block per if statement
4. else is optional - you can have if without else
5. The else block executes when the if condition is False

COMMON PATTERNS
---------------
Pattern 1: Binary choice
  if condition:
      do_this()
  else:
      do_that()

Pattern 2: Validation with feedback
  if is_valid:
      print("Success!")
  else:
      print("Error message")

Pattern 3: Default value assignment
  if user_input:
      value = user_input
  else:
      value = "default"

================================================================================

SECTION 2.5: THE ELIF STATEMENT
--------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The elif statement (short for "else if") allows us to check additional 
conditions when the preceding if condition is False. If the elif condition 
is True, its code block executes. You can have multiple elif statements 
between an if and an else.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The elif statement provides a way to check multiple conditions in sequence. 
It's like saying "if the first condition isn't true, check this second 
condition. If that's not true either, check this third condition," and so on.

SYNTAX
------
  if condition1:
      # Code if condition1 is True
      statement1
  elif condition2:
      # Code if condition1 is False but condition2 is True
      statement2
  elif condition3:
      # Code if condition1 and condition2 are False but condition3 is True
      statement3
  else:
      # Code if all conditions are False
      statement4

KEY COMPONENTS
--------------
1. elif - Keyword meaning "else if"
2. condition - A Boolean expression to evaluate
3. : (colon) - Required punctuation
4. Indented code block - Code that executes if this condition is True
5. Must come after an if statement
6. Can have multiple elif statements
7. Optional else at the end

HOW ELIF WORKS
--------------
Python evaluates conditions in order:
1. Check if condition1 is True
   • If True → execute if block, skip all elif and else
2. If condition1 is False, check condition2
   • If True → execute elif block, skip remaining elif and else
3. If condition2 is False, check condition3
   • If True → execute elif block, skip remaining elif and else
4. Continue until a condition is True or all are False
5. If all conditions are False and there's an else → execute else block

IMPORTANT: Only ONE block executes - the first condition that is True.

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: THE CONCERT EXAMPLE WITH MULTIPLE OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the concert example with three options:

If the individual is 18, they will go to the Pink Floyd concert instead of 
attending the ACDC or Meatloaf concerts.

The person of 18 years of age enters the area. As they are not over 18 years 
of age, they cannot see ACDC. But as they are 18 years, they attend Pink 
Floyd. After seeing Pink Floyd, they move on.

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC IF-ELIF-ELSE STATEMENT
----------------------------------------
  # Set the age
  age = 18
  
  # Check age and assign concert
  if age > 18:
      print("You can enter.")
  elif age == 18:
      print("Go see Pink Floyd.")
  else:
      print("Go see Meatloaf.")
  
  print("Move on.")

Line 2: age = 18
        • Stores 18 in variable age

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check age and assign concert
        • Comment

Line 5: if age > 18:
        • Checks if age (18) is greater than 18
        • 18 > 18 evaluates to False
        • Since False, skip to next condition

Line 6:     print("You can enter.")
        • Part of if block
        • NOT executed (condition was False)

Line 7: elif age == 18:
        • elif - "else if" - checks another condition
        • Checks if age (18) equals 18
        • 18 == 18 evaluates to True
        • Since True, this block WILL execute

Line 8:     print("Go see Pink Floyd.")
        • Part of elif block
        • EXECUTES because condition is True
        • Output: Go see Pink Floyd.

Line 9: else:
        • Alternative if all conditions are False
        • NOT executed because elif condition was True

Line 10:     print("Go see Meatloaf.")
         • Part of else block
         • NOT executed

Line 11: (blank line)

Line 12: print("Move on.")
         • Outside all blocks
         • Always executes
         • Output: Move on.

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python assigns 18 to age
2. Check first condition: age > 18
   • 18 > 18 → False
   • Skip if block
3. Check second condition: age == 18
   • 18 == 18 → True
   • Execute elif block: print("Go see Pink Floyd.")
4. Skip else block (because elif was True)
5. Continue: print("Move on.")

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
Go see Pink Floyd.
Move on.

         • {grade} is replaced with "B"
         • Output: Your final grade is B.

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------
Good job! You got a B.
Your final grade is B.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ELIF ORDER
-------------------------------
The order of elif statements matters! Consider this example:

  score = 85
  
  # WRONG ORDER - This won't work correctly!
  if score >= 60:
      print("D or better")
  elif score >= 70:
      print("C or better")  # This will NEVER execute!
  elif score >= 80:
      print("B or better")  # This will NEVER execute!
  elif score >= 90:
      print("A")  # This will NEVER execute!

Why? Because if score is 85:
• First check: 85 >= 60 → True → executes and stops
• Never checks the other conditions!

CORRECT ORDER:
--------------
  score = 85
  
  # CORRECT ORDER - Check from highest to lowest
  if score >= 90:
      print("A")
  elif score >= 80:
      print("B")  # 85 >= 80 is True, executes this
  elif score >= 70:
      print("C")
  elif score >= 60:
      print("D")
  else:
      print("F")

         • f-string with variable
         • Output: Recommended activity: walking

FINAL OUTPUT:
-------------

Recommended activity: walking

KEY POINTS ABOUT ELIF STATEMENTS
----------------------------------
1. elif must come after an if statement
2. You can have multiple elif statements
3. Only the first True condition's block executes
4. Order matters - check conditions from most specific to least specific
5. elif is optional - you can have if without elif
6. else is optional - you can have if-elif without else

COMMON PATTERNS
---------------
Pattern 1: Range checking
  if value > high:
      # Handle high case
  elif value > medium:
      # Handle medium case
  elif value > low:
      # Handle low case
  else:
      # Handle default case

Pattern 2: Multiple exact matches
  if value == option1:
      # Handle option1
  elif value == option2:
      # Handle option2
  elif value == option3:
      # Handle option3
  else:
      # Handle unknown option

[END SECTION 2.5]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.6: NESTED CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Nested conditional statements are conditional statements (if, elif, else) 
placed inside other conditional statements. This allows for complex decision 
trees with multiple levels of conditions.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Sometimes you need to check conditions within conditions. For example, 
"if the user is logged in, then check if they have admin privileges." This 
requires nesting - placing one conditional statement inside another.

SYNTAX
------
  if condition1:
      # Outer if block
      if condition2:
          # Inner if block
          statement1
      else:
          # Inner else block
          statement2
  else:
      # Outer else block
      statement3

KEY POINTS
----------
• Each level requires its own indentation
• Inner conditions are only checked if outer conditions are True
• Can nest multiple levels deep
• Be careful with indentation - it's easy to make mistakes
• Consider readability - too much nesting can be hard to follow

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC NESTED IF STATEMENTS
---------------------------------------
  # Login and permission check
  is_logged_in = True
  is_admin = True
  
  if is_logged_in:
      print("User is logged in.")
      if is_admin:
          print("User has admin privileges.")
          print("Access granted to admin panel.")
      else:
          print("User does not have admin privileges.")
          print("Access denied to admin panel.")
  else:
      print("User is not logged in.")
      print("Please log in first.")

Line 5: if is_logged_in:
        • Outer if statement
        • Checks if is_logged_in is True
        • True, so outer block executes

Line 6:     print("User is logged in.")
        • Level 1 indentation (outer if block)
        • Executes: Output: User is logged in.

Line 7:     if is_admin:
        • Level 1 indentation (still in outer if block)
        • Inner if statement
        • Checks if is_admin is True
        • True, so inner block executes

Line 8:         print("User has admin privileges.")
        • Level 2 indentation (inner if block)
        • Executes: Output: User has admin privileges.

Line 9:         print("Access granted to admin panel.")
        • Level 2 indentation (inner if block)
        • Executes: Output: Access granted to admin panel.

Line 10:     else:
         • Level 1 indentation (back to outer if level)
         • Inner else block
         • Not executed (inner if was True)

Line 11-12: (Not executed)

Line 13: else:
         • Level 0 (outer else)
         • Not executed (outer if was True)

BEST PRACTICES FOR NESTING
--------------------------
1. Limit nesting depth (3-4 levels max for readability)
2. Consider using elif instead of nested if when possible
3. Use descriptive variable names for conditions
4. Add comments for complex nested logic
5. Consider refactoring deeply nested code into functions

WHEN TO USE NESTING VS ELIF
---------------------------
Use nesting when:
• Conditions are dependent (one must be true before checking the other)
• Example: Check if logged in, THEN check permissions

Use elif when:
• Conditions are independent alternatives
• Example: Check if age is 18, 19, 20, etc. (mutually exclusive)

================================================================================

SECTION 2.8: COMMON PATTERNS AND BEST PRACTICES
------------------------------------------------

PATTERN 1: GUARD CLAUSES (EARLY RETURNS)
------------------------------------------
Instead of deeply nested if-else, use early returns:

  # Instead of this (nested):
  def process_user(user):
      if user:
          if user.is_active:
              if user.has_permission:
                  # Do something
                  return result
              else:
                  return "No permission"
          else:
              return "User inactive"
      else:
          return "No user"
  
  # Do this (guard clauses):
  def process_user(user):
      if not user:
          return "No user"
      if not user.is_active:
          return "User inactive"
      if not user.has_permission:
          return "No permission"
      # Do something
      return result

PATTERN 2: DICTIONARY MAPPING (ALTERNATIVE TO ELIF CHAINS)
-----------------------------------------------------------
For many elif statements checking exact values:

  # Instead of long elif chain:
  if day == "Monday":
      activity = "Work"
  elif day == "Tuesday":
      activity = "Work"
  elif day == "Wednesday":
      activity = "Work"
  # ... many more elifs
  
  # Use dictionary:
  activities = {
      "Monday": "Work",
      "Tuesday": "Work",
      "Wednesday": "Work",
      "Saturday": "Relax",
      "Sunday": "Relax"
  }
  activity = activities.get(day, "Unknown")

PATTERN 3: CHAINED COMPARISONS
------------------------------
Python allows chaining comparisons:

  # Instead of:
  if age >= 18 and age <= 65:
      print("Working age")
  
  # You can write:
  if 18 <= age <= 65:
      print("Working age")

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
1. Keep conditions simple and readable
2. Use descriptive variable names for conditions
3. Avoid deep nesting (3-4 levels max)
4. Use elif for mutually exclusive conditions
5. Always include comments for complex logic
6. Test all branches of your conditional statements
7. Consider using functions to simplify complex conditionals

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-------------------------
1. Using = instead of == in conditions
2. Forgetting the colon (:) after if/elif/else
3. Incorrect indentation
4. Not handling all possible cases
5. Overly complex nested conditions
6. Comparing different data types incorrectly
