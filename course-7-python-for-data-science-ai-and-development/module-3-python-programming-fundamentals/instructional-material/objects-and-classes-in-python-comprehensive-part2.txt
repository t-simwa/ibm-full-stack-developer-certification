OBJECTS AND CLASSES IN PYTHON
Comprehensive Study Guide - Part 2
================================================================================

WELCOME TO PART 2
-----------------
This part continues from Part 1 and covers creating your own custom classes in 
Python. You'll learn how to define classes, create objects from those classes, 
and understand the relationship between classes and objects.

ESTIMATED TIME NEEDED
---------------------
15 minutes (for basic reading)
90-120 minutes (for comprehensive study with practice)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-------------------
After studying this part, you will be able to:
• Explain what a class is and why you would create one
• Understand the difference between a class and an object
• Define your own custom classes in Python
• Understand what data attributes are
• Create objects (instances) from your classes
• Understand what a constructor is and how __init__ works
• Explain what the self parameter is and why it's needed
• Access and modify data attributes of objects
• Create multiple objects from the same class
• Understand the Circle and Rectangle class examples

OVERVIEW
--------
In Part 1, we learned that everything in Python is an object and that objects 
have types. We worked with built-in types like int, str, list, and dict. 

In this part, we'll learn how to create our own custom types (classes). This is 
one of the most powerful features of object-oriented programming - the ability 
to create new types that model real-world concepts or solve specific problems.

We'll use two examples throughout:
1. A Circle class - to represent circles with radius and color
2. A Rectangle class - to represent rectangles with height, width, and color

These examples will teach you all the fundamental concepts of creating classes 
in Python.

PART 2: CREATING YOUR OWN CLASSES
================================================================================

SECTION 2.1: WHY CREATE YOUR OWN CLASSES?
------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
You can create your own type or class in Python. A class is a blueprint or 
template for creating objects. When you create a class, you're defining a new 
type that can have its own data attributes and methods.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
So far, we've worked with Python's built-in types (int, str, list, dict, etc.). 
But what if you need to represent something that doesn't fit neatly into these 
built-in types? That's when you create your own class.

WHY CREATE CUSTOM CLASSES?
--------------------------
1. MODEL REAL-WORLD CONCEPTS
   Classes let you represent real-world things in your code. For example:
   • A "BankAccount" class to represent bank accounts
   • A "Student" class to represent students
   • A "Car" class to represent cars
   • A "Circle" class to represent circles

2. ORGANIZE YOUR CODE
   Classes group related data and functions together, making your code more 
   organized and easier to understand.

3. REUSABILITY
   Once you define a class, you can create many objects from it. Write the code 
   once, use it many times.

4. ENCAPSULATION
   Classes bundle data and the functions that work with that data together. This 
   keeps related things together.

5. ABSTRACTION
   Classes hide complexity. You can use a class without knowing all the details 
   of how it works internally.

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of a class like a cookie cutter:
• The COOKIE CUTTER (class) is the template or blueprint
• Each COOKIE (object) made with that cutter is an instance
• All cookies have the same shape (same type), but each cookie is separate
• You can make many cookies from one cutter (many objects from one class)

Similarly:
• A CIRCLE CLASS is the blueprint
• Each circle object you create is an instance
• All circles have radius and color (same attributes), but each circle can have 
  different values
• You can create many circle objects from one Circle class

WHAT YOU'LL CREATE
------------------
When you create a class, you define:
• DATA ATTRIBUTES: What information the objects will store
• METHODS: What actions the objects can perform

For example, a Circle class might have:
• Data attributes: radius, color
• Methods: calculate_area(), draw(), resize()

[END SECTION 2.1]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.2: UNDERSTANDING CLASSES VS OBJECTS
---------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
A class is a blueprint or template. An object is a specific instance created 
from that class. Classes define what objects will be like; objects are the 
actual things you work with.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
This is a crucial distinction to understand:

CLASS = BLUEPRINT
-----------------
A class is like a blueprint for a house:
• It defines what a house will have (rooms, doors, windows)
• It doesn't create an actual house
• You can use the blueprint to build many houses
• All houses built from the blueprint have the same structure, but each house 
  is different (different address, different furniture, etc.)

OBJECT = INSTANCE
-----------------
An object is like an actual house built from the blueprint:
• It's a real, concrete thing you can use
• It has actual values (specific address, specific furniture)
• You can interact with it (live in it, decorate it)
• Many objects can be created from one class

KEY DIFFERENCES
---------------
CLASS:
• Defined once
• Acts as a template
• Doesn't store actual data
• Defines what attributes and methods objects will have

OBJECT:
• Created many times from a class
• Stores actual data
• Has specific values for its attributes
• You can call methods on it

VISUAL EXAMPLE
--------------
Class (Circle):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Circle Class           │  ← This is the blueprint
│                             │

     ↓                ↓                ↓
  All created from the same Circle class
  But each has different values

ANALOGY: CAR MANUFACTURING
---------------------------
• CLASS = Car design/blueprint
  - Defines: 4 wheels, engine, doors, seats
  - Doesn't create an actual car
  
• OBJECT = Actual car
  - Car #1: Red, license plate ABC-123
  - Car #2: Blue, license plate XYZ-789
  - Car #3: Green, license plate DEF-456
  - All are cars (same class), but each is different (different objects)

[END SECTION 2.2]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.3: PLANNING YOUR CLASS - DATA ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Data attributes are the pieces of information that define what an object is. 
They're like variables that belong to the object. Before creating a class, you 
need to decide what data attributes it should have.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
When you're planning to create a class, the first step is to think about what 
information (data) objects of that class need to store. These pieces of 
information are called data attributes.

THINKING ABOUT THE CIRCLE CLASS
-------------------------------
Let's think about what constitutes a circle. Examining a circle, all we need is 
a radius to define a circle. The radius is the distance from the center of the 
circle to any point on its edge.

But let's also add color to make it easier to distinguish between different 
instances of the class later. Color will help us visually identify different 
circle objects.

Therefore, our class data attributes are:
• radius - the size of the circle
• color - the color of the circle

THINKING ABOUT THE RECTANGLE CLASS
----------------------------------
Similarly, examining a rectangle, in order to define a rectangle, we need the 
height and width. These two measurements completely define the size and shape 
of a rectangle.

We will also add color to distinguish between instances later. This helps us 
tell different rectangle objects apart.

Therefore, the data attributes are:
• color - the color of the rectangle
• height - the vertical measurement
• width - the horizontal measurement

WHY PLAN DATA ATTRIBUTES FIRST?
-------------------------------
Planning data attributes first helps you:
• Understand what your class needs to represent
• Think about what information is essential
• Design your class before writing code
• Avoid missing important attributes
• Make your class complete and useful

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of data attributes like the fields on a form:
• When you fill out a job application, the form has fields: name, address, 
  phone, email, etc.
• These fields define what information the application needs
• Similarly, data attributes define what information your objects need

For a Circle:
• radius: How big is the circle?
• color: What color is the circle?

For a Rectangle:
• height: How tall is the rectangle?
• width: How wide is the rectangle?
• color: What color is the rectangle?

[END SECTION 2.3]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.4: THE CIRCLE CLASS EXAMPLE
---------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The Circle class is a custom class we'll create to represent circles. Each 
circle object will have a radius and a color.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Let's use the Circle class as our first example of creating a custom class. 
This will teach you all the fundamental concepts.

WHAT WE WANT TO CREATE
----------------------
We want to be able to create circle objects like this:

circle1 = Circle(radius=4, color="red")
circle2 = Circle(radius=2, color="green")

Each circle object should:
• Store its radius
• Store its color
• Be able to perform actions (methods) like calculating area, drawing, etc.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
What we're building:

Circle Class (Blueprint):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Circle Class           │
│                             │
│  Data Attributes:           │
│    • radius                 │
│    • color                  │
│                             │
│  Methods:                   │
│    • (we'll add these       │
│       in Part 3)            │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Circle Objects (Instances):
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Circle    │      │   Circle    │
│  Object 1   │      │  Object 2   │
│             │      │             │
│ radius: 4   │      │ radius: 2   │
│ color: red  │      │ color: green│
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘

We can create an object that is an instance of type circle. The color data 
attribute is red, and the data attribute radius is four.

We can also create a second object that is an instance of type circle. In this 
case, the color data attribute is green, and the data attribute radius is two.

Both objects are circles (same type), but they have different values (different 
objects).

[END SECTION 2.4]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.5: THE RECTANGLE CLASS EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The Rectangle class is a custom class we'll create to represent rectangles. 
Each rectangle object will have a height, width, and color.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The Rectangle class is our second example. It's similar to Circle but has 
different data attributes.

WHAT WE WANT TO CREATE
----------------------
We want to be able to create rectangle objects like this:

rect1 = Rectangle(height=2, width=2, color="blue")
rect2 = Rectangle(height=1, width=3, color="yellow")

Each rectangle object should:
• Store its height
• Store its width
• Store its color
• Be able to perform actions (methods) like calculating area, drawing, etc.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
What we're building:

Rectangle Class (Blueprint):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    Rectangle Class          │
│                             │
│  Data Attributes:           │
│    • color                  │
│    • height                 │
│    • width                  │
│                             │
│  Methods:                   │
│    • (we'll add these       │
│       in Part 3)            │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Rectangle Objects (Instances):
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ Rectangle   │      │ Rectangle   │
│  Object 1   │      │  Object 2   │
│             │      │             │
│ color: blue │      │ color:      │
│ height: 2   │      │   yellow    │
│ width: 2    │      │ height: 1   │
│             │      │ width: 3    │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘

We can create an object that is an instance of type rectangle. The color data 
attribute is blue, and the data attributes of height and width are both two.

The second object is also an instance of type rectangle. In this case, the 
color data attribute is yellow, and the height is one, and the width is three.

We now have different objects of class circle or type circle. We also have 
different objects of class rectangle or type rectangle.

[END SECTION 2.5]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.6: CLASS DEFINITION SYNTAX
-------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
To create the class circle, you will need to include the class definition. This 
tells Python you are creating your own class, the name of the class, and that 
it inherits from object.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Now let's learn the actual Python syntax for creating a class.

BASIC CLASS DEFINITION SYNTAX
------------------------------
class ClassName(object):
    """Optional documentation string"""
    # Class body
    # Data attributes and methods go here

BREAKDOWN OF THE SYNTAX
-----------------------
1. class
   - This is a Python keyword that starts a class definition
   - It tells Python "I'm creating a new class"

2. ClassName
   - This is the name of your class
   - Follow Python naming conventions: start with capital letter, use 
     CamelCase for multiple words
   - Examples: Circle, Rectangle, BankAccount, StudentRecord

3. (object)
   - This is the parent class
   - For this course, you will always place the term object in parentheses
   - "object" is the base class that all classes inherit from in Python
   - This makes your class a "new-style" class (Python 3 style)
   - In Python 3, you can actually omit "(object)" and it will work the same, 
     but including it is explicit and clear

4. :
   - The colon indicates the start of the class body
   - Everything indented after the colon is part of the class

5. Class body
   - This is where you define data attributes and methods
   - Everything must be indented (typically 4 spaces)

EXAMPLE: CIRCLE CLASS DEFINITION
---------------------------------
Code:
class Circle(object):
    pass

Line-by-line explanation:
• class Circle(object):
  - "class" is the keyword
  - "Circle" is the name we're giving to our class
  - "(object)" means this class inherits from the object class
  - ":" starts the class body
  
• pass
  - "pass" is a placeholder that does nothing
  - It's used when you need a statement but don't want to do anything yet
  - This creates an empty class (we'll add content next)

EXAMPLE: RECTANGLE CLASS DEFINITION
------------------------------------
Code:
class Rectangle(object):
    pass

Line-by-line explanation:
• class Rectangle(object):
  - Same structure as Circle
  - "Rectangle" is the name of this class
  - For the class rectangle, we change the name of the class, but the rest is 
    kept the same
  
• pass
  - Placeholder for now

CLASSES ARE OUTLINES
--------------------
Classes are outlines - we have to set the attributes to create objects. Right 
now, our classes are empty. In the next sections, we'll add:
• A constructor (__init__) to initialize objects
• Data attributes to store information
• Methods to perform actions

[END SECTION 2.6]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.7: UNDERSTANDING THE CONSTRUCTOR (__init__)
------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The __init__ function is a constructor. It's a special function that tells 
Python you are making a new class instance. The constructor initializes each 
instance of the class with data attributes.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
When you create an object from a class, Python automatically calls a special 
method called __init__. This method is called the constructor because it 
"constructs" (creates and initializes) the object.

WHAT IS __init__?
-----------------
• __init__ is a special method name in Python
• The double underscores (__) before and after "init" indicate it's a special 
  method
• It's automatically called when you create a new object
• It's used to set up (initialize) the object's data attributes

SYNTAX
------
def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    """Initialize the object"""
    self.attribute1 = parameter1
    self.attribute2 = parameter2
    # More initialization code

COMPLETE CIRCLE CLASS WITH CONSTRUCTOR
--------------------------------------
Let us continue building the circle class in Python. We define our class. We 
then initialize each instance of the class with data attributes, radius and 
color using the class constructor.

Code:
class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self, radius, color):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color

Line-by-line explanation:
• class Circle(object):
  - Defines the Circle class
  - Inherits from object
  
• def __init__(self, radius, color):
  - "def" defines a function (method)
  - "__init__" is the special constructor method name
  - "self" is the first parameter (refers to the object being created)
  - "radius" is a parameter that will be passed when creating a circle
  - "color" is another parameter that will be passed when creating a circle
  - ":" starts the method body
  
• self.radius = radius
  - "self.radius" creates a data attribute called "radius" on the object
  - "=" assigns a value to this attribute
  - "radius" (on the right) is the parameter value passed to the constructor
  - This sets the radius data attribute to the value passed in
  
• self.color = color
  - "self.color" creates a data attribute called "color" on the object
  - "=" assigns a value to this attribute
  - "color" (on the right) is the parameter value passed to the constructor
  - This sets the color data attribute to the value passed in

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE AN OBJECT
---------------------------------------
When you write: my_circle = Circle(radius=10, color="red")

Python does this:
1. Creates a new, empty Circle object
2. Calls __init__(self, radius=10, color="red")
3. Inside __init__:
   - self.radius = 10 (sets the radius attribute)
   - self.color = "red" (sets the color attribute)
4. Returns the initialized object
5. Assigns it to my_circle

THE PARAMETERS
--------------
The radius and color parameters are used to initialize the radius and color 
data attributes of the class instance. These parameters allow you to set 
different values for each object you create.

OTHER SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
-----------------------
There are other special functions in Python to make more complex classes. For 
example:
• __str__ - defines how the object is displayed as a string
• __len__ - defines what len(object) returns
• __add__ - defines what happens when you use + operator
• And many more!

For now, we'll focus on __init__, which is the most important one.

COMPLETE RECTANGLE CLASS WITH CONSTRUCTOR
-----------------------------------------
Similarly, we can define the class rectangle in Python. The name of the class 
is different. This time, the class data attributes are color, height and width.

Code:
class Rectangle(object):
    def __init__(self, color, height, width):
        self.color = color
        self.height = height
        self.width = width

Line-by-line explanation:
• class Rectangle(object):
  - Defines the Rectangle class
  
• def __init__(self, color, height, width):
  - Constructor method
  - Takes three parameters: color, height, width
  - "self" always comes first
  
• self.color = color
  - Sets the color data attribute
  
• self.height = height
  - Sets the height data attribute
  
• self.width = width
  - Sets the width data attribute

[END SECTION 2.7]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.8: UNDERSTANDING THE SELF PARAMETER
----------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The self parameter refers to the newly created instance of the class. It's how 
you access and modify the object's data attributes from within methods.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The self parameter is one of the most important concepts in Python classes, 
and it's often confusing for beginners. Let's break it down completely.

WHAT IS SELF?
-------------
• "self" is a reference to the current object instance
• It's the first parameter of every method in a class
• When you call a method, Python automatically passes the object as "self"
• You use "self" to access the object's data attributes and other methods

WHY IS IT CALLED "SELF"?
------------------------
"self" refers to "this object itself" - the object that the method is being 
called on. It's like saying "this object" or "myself" in English.

You could actually name it anything (like "this" or "obj"), but "self" is the 
universal convention in Python, and you should always use it.

HOW SELF WORKS
--------------
When you write:
my_circle = Circle(radius=10, color="red")

Python internally does:
Circle.__init__(self=my_circle, radius=10, color="red")

Notice that Python automatically passes my_circle as the self parameter!

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
Think of self as a box that contains all the data attributes of the object:

When you create: my_circle = Circle(radius=10, color="red")

┌─────────────────────────┐
│      my_circle          │  ← This is the object
│   (the "self" box)      │
├─────────────────────────┤
│  self.radius = 10       │  ← Data attribute
│  self.color = "red"     │  ← Data attribute
└─────────────────────────┘

Inside __init__, "self" refers to this box.

INSIDE THE CONSTRUCTOR
---------------------
Let's trace through what happens:

Code:
class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self, radius, color):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color

When you call: Circle(radius=10, color="red")

Step-by-step:
1. Python creates a new, empty Circle object
2. Python calls: __init__(self=<new_object>, radius=10, color="red")
3. Inside __init__:
   • self.radius = radius
     - self refers to the new object
     - self.radius creates/accesses the radius attribute on that object
     - = radius assigns the value 10 (from the parameter) to self.radius
   
   • self.color = color
     - self refers to the new object
     - self.color creates/accesses the color attribute on that object
     - = color assigns the value "red" (from the parameter) to self.color

4. The object now has radius=10 and color="red"
5. Python returns this initialized object
6. It gets assigned to my_circle

THE PARAMETERS VS SELF
----------------------
The parameters radius and color can be used in the constructor's body to 
access the values passed to the class constructor when the class is constructed.

• radius (parameter) = the value passed in (e.g., 10)
• self.radius (attribute) = the data stored in the object

We can set the value of the radius and color data attributes to the values 
passed to the constructor method.

EXAMPLE WITH MULTIPLE OBJECTS
------------------------------
Code:
circle1 = Circle(radius=5, color="blue")
circle2 = Circle(radius=8, color="green")

What happens:

For circle1:
• self (inside __init__) refers to circle1
• self.radius = 5
• self.color = "blue"

For circle2:
• self (inside __init__) refers to circle2
• self.radius = 8
• self.color = "green"

Each object has its own "self" - its own data!

KEY POINTS ABOUT SELF
---------------------
1. SELF IS ALWAYS THE FIRST PARAMETER
   Every method in a class must have self as the first parameter.

2. YOU DON'T PASS SELF YOURSELF
   When calling a method, you don't pass self - Python does it automatically.

3. SELF REFERS TO THE OBJECT CALLING THE METHOD
   If you call circle1.some_method(), then self inside some_method refers to 
   circle1.

4. SELF IS HOW YOU ACCESS OBJECT DATA
   Use self.attribute_name to get or set data attributes.

5. WITHOUT SELF, YOU CAN'T ACCESS OBJECT DATA
   Methods need self to know which object's data to work with.

[END SECTION 2.8]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.9: CREATING OBJECTS FROM CLASSES
---------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
After we have created the class, in order to create an object of class circle, 
we introduce a variable. This will be the name of the object. We create the 
object by using the object constructor.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Creating an object from a class is also called "instantiating" the class or 
"creating an instance" of the class. The process is straightforward once you 
understand it.

THE PROCESS
----------
1. Write the class name (like Circle or Rectangle)
2. Add parentheses (like calling a function)
3. Pass arguments for the constructor parameters
4. Assign the result to a variable

SYNTAX
------
variable_name = ClassName(argument1, argument2, ...)

Or with keyword arguments:
variable_name = ClassName(parameter1=value1, parameter2=value2, ...)

EXAMPLE: CREATING A CIRCLE OBJECT
----------------------------------
Code:
RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")

Line-by-line explanation:
• RedCircle
  - This is a variable name
  - It will hold a reference to the circle object we're creating
  - This will be the name of the object (or more accurately, the variable 
    that refers to the object)
  
• =
  - Assignment operator
  - Assigns the created object to the variable RedCircle
  
• Circle
  - This is the class name
  - Python knows to create a Circle object
  
• (radius=3, color="red")
  - These are the arguments passed to the __init__ constructor
  - radius=3 means the radius parameter gets the value 3
  - color="red" means the color parameter gets the value "red"
  - When we create a circle object, we call the code like a function
  
• The arguments passed to the circle constructor are used to initialize the 
  data attributes of the newly created circle instance

WHAT HAPPENS INTERNALLY
-----------------------
When you write: RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")

Python does this:
1. Creates a new, empty Circle object in memory
2. Calls Circle.__init__(self=<new_object>, radius=3, color="red")
3. Inside __init__:
   - self.radius = 3
   - self.color = "red"
4. Returns the initialized object
5. Assigns it to RedCircle

Now RedCircle refers to a Circle object with radius=3 and color="red".

EXAMPLE: CREATING MULTIPLE CIRCLE OBJECTS
------------------------------------------
Code:
# First circle object
RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")

# Second circle object
BlueCircle = Circle(radius=10, color="blue")

Line-by-line explanation:
• RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")
  - Creates the first circle object
  - Radius is 3, color is red
  - Variable name is RedCircle
  
• BlueCircle = Circle(radius=10, color="blue")
  - Creates a second circle object
  - This is a completely separate object from RedCircle
  - Radius is 10, color is blue
  - Variable name is BlueCircle

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
After creating both objects:

┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Circle    │         │   Circle    │
│   Object    │         │   Object    │
│             │         │             │
│ radius: 3   │         │ radius: 10  │
│ color: red  │         │ color: blue │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
      ↑                       ↑
   RedCircle              BlueCircle

Two separate objects, both instances of Circle class.

EXAMPLE: CREATING RECTANGLE OBJECTS
------------------------------------
Code:
# First rectangle object
BlueRect = Rectangle(color="blue", height=2, width=2)

# Second rectangle object
YellowRect = Rectangle(color="yellow", height=1, width=3)

Line-by-line explanation:
• BlueRect = Rectangle(color="blue", height=2, width=2)
  - Creates a rectangle object
  - Color is blue, height is 2, width is 2
  - Variable name is BlueRect
  
• YellowRect = Rectangle(color="yellow", height=1, width=3)
  - Creates a second rectangle object
  - Color is yellow, height is 1, width is 3
  - Variable name is YellowRect

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│ Rectangle   │         │ Rectangle   │
│   Object    │         │   Object    │
│             │         │             │
│ color: blue │         │ color:      │
│ height: 2   │         │   yellow    │
│ width: 2    │         │ height: 1   │
│             │         │ width: 3    │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
      ↑                       ↑
   BlueRect              YellowRect

KEY POINTS
----------
1. CREATING AN OBJECT IS LIKE CALLING A FUNCTION
   You use the class name like a function call.

2. EACH OBJECT IS INDEPENDENT
   Creating multiple objects creates separate instances with their own data.

3. THE VARIABLE NAME IS JUST A LABEL
   The variable (like RedCircle) is just a name that refers to the object. 
   The object itself exists independently.

4. YOU CAN CREATE MANY OBJECTS FROM ONE CLASS
   There's no limit to how many objects you can create from a class.

SECTION 2.10: ACCESSING DATA ATTRIBUTES
-----------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Typing the object's name followed by a dot and the data attribute name gives 
us the data attribute value. This is how you access (read) the data stored in 
an object.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Once you've created an object, you'll want to access its data attributes to 
see what values they have. This is done using dot notation.

SYNTAX
------
object_name.attribute_name

Where:
• object_name is the variable that refers to the object
• . (dot) is the access operator
• attribute_name is the name of the data attribute you want to access

THE BOX ANALOGY
---------------
It is helpful to think of self as a box that contains all the data attributes 
of the object. When you access an attribute, you're looking inside the box.

┌─────────────────────────┐
│      The Object         │
│      (The Box)          │
├─────────────────────────┤
│  radius: 10             │  ← Data attribute
│  color: "red"           │  ← Data attribute
└─────────────────────────┘

When you write object_name.radius, you're saying "give me the radius value 
from this object's box."

EXAMPLE: ACCESSING CIRCLE ATTRIBUTES
-------------------------------------
Code:
RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")

# Access the radius attribute
print(RedCircle.radius)

# Access the color attribute
print(RedCircle.color)

Line-by-line explanation:
• RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")
  - Creates a circle object with radius=3 and color="red"
  - The variable RedCircle refers to this object
  
• print(RedCircle.radius)
  - "RedCircle" refers to our circle object
  - "." accesses an attribute
  - "radius" is the attribute name we want
  - RedCircle.radius gets the value of the radius attribute (which is 3)
  - print() displays this value
  
• print(RedCircle.color)
  - Similarly accesses the color attribute
  - Gets the value "red"
  - print() displays it

Output:
3
red

In this case, the radius is 3. We can do the same for color. We can see the 
relationship between the self parameter and the object.

EXAMPLE: ACCESSING RECTANGLE ATTRIBUTES
----------------------------------------
Code:
BlueRect = Rectangle(color="blue", height=2, width=2)

# Access each attribute
print("Color:", BlueRect.color)
print("Height:", BlueRect.height)
print("Width:", BlueRect.width)

Line-by-line explanation:
• BlueRect = Rectangle(color="blue", height=2, width=2)
  - Creates a rectangle object
  
• print("Color:", BlueRect.color)
  - Accesses the color attribute
  - Gets "blue"
  
• print("Height:", BlueRect.height)
  - Accesses the height attribute
  - Gets 2
  
• print("Width:", BlueRect.width)
  - Accesses the width attribute
  - Gets 2

Output:
Color: blue
Height: 2
Width: 2

COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE
---------------------
Code:
# Create multiple circle objects
RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")
BlueCircle = Circle(radius=10, color="blue")

# Access attributes of first circle
print("Red Circle:")
print("  Radius:", RedCircle.radius)
print("  Color:", RedCircle.color)

# Access attributes of second circle
print("\nBlue Circle:")
print("  Radius:", BlueCircle.radius)
print("  Color:", BlueCircle.color)

Line-by-line explanation:
• Creates two circle objects with different values
• Accesses and displays each object's attributes
• Shows that each object has its own independent data

Output:
Red Circle:
  Radius: 3
  Color: red

Blue Circle:
  Radius: 10
  Color: blue

KEY POINTS
----------
1. DOT NOTATION IS USED TO ACCESS ATTRIBUTES
   object.attribute gets the value

2. EACH OBJECT HAS ITS OWN ATTRIBUTES
   RedCircle.radius and BlueCircle.radius are different values

3. ATTRIBUTES ARE ACCESSED THE SAME WAY THEY'RE SET
   In __init__, we set self.radius
   Outside, we access object.radius

4. YOU CAN USE ATTRIBUTES IN EXPRESSIONS
   area = 3.14 * circle.radius * circle.radius

[END SECTION 2.10]
================================================================================

SECTION 2.11: MODIFYING DATA ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
In Python, we can also set or change the data attribute directly, typing the 
object's name followed by a dot and the data attribute name and set it equal 
to the corresponding value.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Not only can you read data attributes, but you can also modify them after the 
object has been created. This allows you to change an object's state.

SYNTAX
------
object_name.attribute_name = new_value

Where:
• object_name is the variable referring to the object
• .attribute_name is the attribute you want to change
• = assigns a new value
• new_value is the new value you want to assign

EXAMPLE: CHANGING CIRCLE COLOR
-------------------------------
Code:
RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")
print("Original color:", RedCircle.color)

# Change the color
RedCircle.color = "purple"
print("New color:", RedCircle.color)

Line-by-line explanation:
• RedCircle = Circle(radius=3, color="red")
  - Creates a circle with color="red"
  
• print("Original color:", RedCircle.color)
  - Shows the original color (red)
  
• RedCircle.color = "purple"
  - "RedCircle" refers to our circle object
  - ".color" accesses the color attribute
  - "=" assigns a new value
  - "purple" is the new value
  - This directly modifies the object's color attribute
  
• print("New color:", RedCircle.color)
  - Shows the new color (purple)

Output:
Original color: red
New color: purple

We can verify that the color data attribute has changed.

EXAMPLE: CHANGING CIRCLE RADIUS
--------------------------------
Code:
my_circle = Circle(radius=5, color="blue")
print("Original radius:", my_circle.radius)

# Change the radius
my_circle.radius = 8
print("New radius:", my_circle.radius)

Output:
Original radius: 5
New radius: 8

EXAMPLE: CHANGING RECTANGLE ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------------------
Code:
my_rect = Rectangle(color="green", height=3, width=4)
print("Original:", my_rect.color, my_rect.height, my_rect.width)

# Change multiple attributes
my_rect.color = "orange"
my_rect.height = 5
my_rect.width = 6

print("Modified:", my_rect.color, my_rect.height, my_rect.width)

Output:
Original: green 3 4
Modified: orange 5 6

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
Before modification:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      RedCircle          │
├─────────────────────────┤
│  radius: 3              │
│  color: "red"           │
└─────────────────────────┘

After RedCircle.color = "purple":
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      RedCircle          │
├─────────────────────────┤
│  radius: 3              │
│  color: "purple"        │  ← Changed!
└─────────────────────────┘

BEST PRACTICE
-------------
Usually, in order to change the data in an object, we define methods in the 
class. Direct modification works, but using methods is generally better 
because:
• Methods can validate the new value
• Methods can perform additional actions when data changes
• Methods provide a controlled way to modify objects
• Methods make the code more maintainable

We'll learn about methods in Part 3.

KEY POINTS
----------
1. YOU CAN MODIFY ATTRIBUTES DIRECTLY
   object.attribute = new_value

2. CHANGES AFFECT THE OBJECT IMMEDIATELY
   The object's state changes right away

3. EACH OBJECT'S ATTRIBUTES ARE INDEPENDENT
   Changing one object doesn't affect others

4. DIRECT MODIFICATION IS SIMPLE BUT METHODS ARE BETTER
   For now, direct modification is fine, but methods are the preferred approach

================================================================================

SECTION 2.12: CREATING MULTIPLE OBJECTS FROM ONE CLASS
--------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
You can create many objects from a single class. Each object is independent and 
has its own data attributes. We have a class, and an object that is a realization 
or instantiation of that class.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
One of the powerful features of classes is that you can create many objects 
from one class definition. Each object is separate and independent.

EXAMPLE: MULTIPLE CIRCLE OBJECTS
---------------------------------
For example, we can create two objects of class circle or two objects of class 
rectangle.

Code:
# Create first circle object
circle1 = Circle(radius=4, color="red")

# Create second circle object
circle2 = Circle(radius=2, color="green")

# Each object is independent
print("Circle 1 - Radius:", circle1.radius, "Color:", circle1.color)
print("Circle 2 - Radius:", circle2.radius, "Color:", circle2.color)

Line-by-line explanation:
• circle1 = Circle(radius=4, color="red")
  - Creates the first circle object
  - Radius is 4, color is red
  
• circle2 = Circle(radius=2, color="green")
  - Creates a second circle object
  - This is completely separate from circle1
  - Radius is 2, color is green
  
• print statements
  - Show that each object has its own values
  - Modifying one doesn't affect the other

Output:
Circle 1 - Radius: 4 Color: red
Circle 2 - Radius: 2 Color: green

EXAMPLE: MULTIPLE RECTANGLE OBJECTS
------------------------------------
Code:
# Create first rectangle object
rect1 = Rectangle(color="blue", height=2, width=2)

# Create second rectangle object
rect2 = Rectangle(color="yellow", height=1, width=3)

# Each object is independent
print("Rectangle 1 - Color:", rect1.color, "Height:", rect1.height, "Width:", rect1.width)
print("Rectangle 2 - Color:", rect2.color, "Height:", rect2.height, "Width:", rect2.width)

Output:
Rectangle 1 - Color: blue Height: 2 Width: 2
Rectangle 2 - Color: yellow Height: 1 Width: 3

VISUAL REPRESENTATION
---------------------
One class, multiple objects:

Circle Class (Blueprint):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Circle Class           │
│                             │

    Creates    Creates
         ↓           ↓

│ color: red  │  │ color: green│
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
     ↑                ↑
  circle1          circle2

INDEPENDENCE DEMONSTRATION
--------------------------
Code:
# Create two circles
circle1 = Circle(radius=5, color="red")
circle2 = Circle(radius=5, color="red")  # Same values, but different object!

# Modify circle1
circle1.radius = 10

# Check both circles
print("Circle 1 radius:", circle1.radius)  # Changed to 10
print("Circle 2 radius:", circle2.radius)  # Still 5!

Output:
Circle 1 radius: 10
Circle 2 radius: 5

This proves they are separate objects!

KEY CONCEPTS
------------
1. ONE CLASS, MANY OBJECTS
   You define the class once, but can create unlimited objects from it.

2. EACH OBJECT IS INDEPENDENT
   Objects don't share data - each has its own copy.

3. OBJECTS CAN HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES
   Even though they're the same type, they can store different data.

4. MODIFYING ONE OBJECT DOESN'T AFFECT OTHERS
   Changes to one object are isolated to that object.

5. OBJECTS ARE INSTANCES OF THE CLASS
   Each object is an instance (realization) of the class blueprint.
