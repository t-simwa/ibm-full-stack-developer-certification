CONDITIONS AND BRANCHING IN PYTHON
Comprehensive Study Guide - Part 1
================================================================================

WELCOME
-------
Welcome to Conditions and Branching in Python. This comprehensive guide will 
teach you everything you need to know about making decisions in your Python 
programs, from understanding comparison operations and Boolean values, to 
mastering conditional statements and logic operators.

ESTIMATED TIME NEEDED
---------------------
5 minutes (for basic reading)
90-120 minutes (for comprehensive study with practice)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-------------------
After studying this guide, you will be able to:
• Understand what comparison operations are and how they work
• Explain Boolean values (True and False) and their purpose
• Use all comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
• Compare different data types (integers, floats, strings)
• Understand how comparison operations produce Boolean results
• Recognize when and why to use comparison operations
• Apply comparison operations in real-world scenarios

OVERVIEW
--------
In programming, you often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. 
For example, "If the user is 18 or older, allow them to access the website" 
or "If the temperature is above 100 degrees, turn on the air conditioning."

Python provides comparison operations that allow you to compare values and 
produce Boolean results (True or False). These Boolean results are then used 
in conditional statements (if, else, elif) to control the flow of your program.

Comparison operations are fundamental to programming because they allow your 
programs to:
• Make decisions based on data
• Validate user input
• Control program flow
• Filter and process data conditionally

PART 1: COMPARISON OPERATIONS AND BOOLEAN VALUES
================================================================================

SECTION 1.1: WHAT ARE COMPARISON OPERATIONS?
---------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Comparison operations compare some value or operand. Then, based on some 
condition, they produce a Boolean value (True or False).

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Comparison operations are operations that compare two values and determine 
the relationship between them. They answer questions like:
• Are these two values equal?
• Is this value greater than that value?
• Is this value less than that value?

When you perform a comparison operation, Python evaluates the comparison and 
returns a Boolean value:
• True - if the comparison is correct
• False - if the comparison is incorrect

KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
• Comparison operations always produce Boolean results (True or False)
• They compare two operands (values or variables)
• The operands can be of the same or compatible types
• Comparison operations are used in conditional statements
• They form the foundation of decision-making in programs

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of comparison operations like a scale or balance:
• You place two items on the scale (two values to compare)
• The scale tells you which is heavier, lighter, or if they're equal
• The result is definitive: one is heavier, lighter, or they're equal

In programming:
• You place two values in a comparison operation
• Python tells you if the comparison is True or False
• The result determines what your program does next

WHY ARE COMPARISON OPERATIONS IMPORTANT?
----------------------------------------
Comparison operations are essential because:
1. They allow programs to make decisions
2. They enable conditional logic (if this, then that)
3. They validate data and user input
4. They control program flow
5. They filter and process data based on conditions

EXAMPLE: BASIC COMPARISON
--------------------------
  # Assign a value to variable a
  a = 6
  
  # Compare a with 7
  result = a == 7
  print(result)  # Output: False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Assign a value to variable a
        • This is a comment explaining what the next line does
        • Comments help document your code
        • Comments are ignored by Python when running the code

Line 2: a = 6
        • a - This is a variable name (a container that holds a value)
        • = - This is the assignment operator (assigns a value to a variable)
        • 6 - This is an integer value (a whole number)
        • This line stores the number 6 in a variable named 'a'
        • Think of it like putting the number 6 in a box labeled 'a'

Line 3: (blank line)
        • Empty lines improve code readability
        • They separate logical sections of code
        • Python ignores blank lines

Line 4: # Compare a with 7
        • Another comment explaining the purpose of the next line

Line 5: result = a == 7
        • result - A new variable to store the comparison result
        • = - Assignment operator (assigns the result to 'result')
        • a - The variable we created earlier (contains 6)
        • == - The equality operator (checks if two values are equal)
        • 7 - The number we're comparing against
        • This line asks: "Is the value in 'a' equal to 7?"
        • Since a contains 6, and 6 is not equal to 7, the answer is False
        • The False value is stored in the 'result' variable

Line 6: print(result)  # Output: False
        • print() - A built-in Python function that displays output
        • result - The variable containing the comparison result (False)
        • This line displays the value stored in 'result'
        • The output will be: False
        • The comment shows what will be displayed

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
1. Python creates a variable 'a' and stores the value 6 in it
2. Python evaluates the comparison: a == 7
   • It looks at what's in 'a' (which is 6)
   • It compares 6 with 7
   • It asks: "Is 6 equal to 7?" → No, so the answer is False
3. Python stores False in the variable 'result'
4. Python displays False on the screen

================================================================================

SECTION 1.2: UNDERSTANDING BOOLEAN VALUES
------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Boolean values are the two possible results of comparison operations: True 
and False. They represent the truth value of a condition.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Boolean values are named after George Boole, a mathematician who developed 
Boolean algebra. In Python, there are exactly two Boolean values:
• True - represents a true condition or affirmative answer
• False - represents a false condition or negative answer

These are not strings (text), but special values in Python that represent 
truth or falsity. They are used throughout programming to make decisions.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF BOOLEAN VALUES
--------------------------------------
• There are only two possible values: True and False
• They are case-sensitive (must be capitalized: True, not true)
• They are used in conditional statements (if, else, elif)
• They control program flow and decision-making
• They are the result of comparison operations
• They can be stored in variables
• They can be used in logic operations (and, or, not)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of Boolean values like a light switch:
• True = Light is ON (condition is true)
• False = Light is OFF (condition is false)

Or like answering yes/no questions:
• "Is it raining?" → True (yes) or False (no)
• "Are you 18 or older?" → True (yes) or False (no)
• "Is 5 greater than 3?" → True (yes)

HOW BOOLEAN VALUES WORK IN PYTHON
----------------------------------
When Python evaluates a comparison, it returns a Boolean value:

  # Example 1: Comparison that is True
  result1 = 5 > 3
  print(result1)  # Output: True
  print(type(result1))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

  # Example 2: Comparison that is False
  result2 = 5 < 3
  print(result2)  # Output: False
  print(type(result2))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Example 1:
----------
Line 1: # Example 1: Comparison that is True
        • Comment describing the example

Line 2: result1 = 5 > 3
        • result1 - Variable name to store the result
        • = - Assignment operator
        • 5 > 3 - Comparison operation: "Is 5 greater than 3?"
        • Since 5 is indeed greater than 3, this evaluates to True
        • True is stored in result1

Line 3: print(result1)  # Output: True
        • Displays the value stored in result1
        • Output: True

Line 4: print(type(result1))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
        • type() - Built-in function that returns the data type of a value
        • result1 - The variable we're checking the type of
        • <class 'bool'> - Shows that result1 is a Boolean type
        • 'bool' is short for Boolean

Example 2:
----------
Line 1: # Example 2: Comparison that is False
        • Comment describing the second example

Line 2: result2 = 5 < 3
        • result2 - Variable name to store the result
        • = - Assignment operator
        • 5 < 3 - Comparison operation: "Is 5 less than 3?"
        • Since 5 is NOT less than 3, this evaluates to False
        • False is stored in result2

Line 3: print(result2)  # Output: False
        • Displays the value stored in result2
        • Output: False

Line 4: print(type(result2))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
        • Shows that result2 is also a Boolean type
        • Confirms that comparison operations always return Boolean values

STORING BOOLEAN VALUES DIRECTLY
--------------------------------
You can also assign Boolean values directly to variables:

  is_raining = True
  is_sunny = False
  user_is_adult = True
  account_is_active = False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: is_raining = True
        • is_raining - Variable name (descriptive name using snake_case)
        • = - Assignment operator
        • True - Boolean value representing "yes, it is raining"
        • This stores True in the variable is_raining

Line 2: is_sunny = False
        • is_sunny - Variable name
        • False - Boolean value representing "no, it is not sunny"
        • This stores False in the variable is_sunny

Line 3: user_is_adult = True
        • user_is_adult - Descriptive variable name
        • True - Represents that the user is an adult
        • Good practice: use descriptive names that explain what the Boolean represents

Line 4: account_is_active = False
        • account_is_active - Variable name
        • False - Represents that the account is not active
        • These Boolean variables can be used later in conditional statements

USING BOOLEAN VALUES IN CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------
Boolean values are primarily used in conditional statements:

  age = 20
  is_adult = age >= 18
  
  if is_adult:
      print("You can vote!")
  else:
      print("You cannot vote yet.")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: age = 20
        • Stores the age value (20) in variable 'age'

Line 2: is_adult = age >= 18
        • age >= 18 - Comparison: "Is age greater than or equal to 18?"
        • Since 20 >= 18 is True, is_adult becomes True
        • This stores True in is_adult

Line 3: (blank line for readability)

Line 4: if is_adult:
        • if - Conditional statement keyword
        • is_adult - The Boolean variable we're checking
        • : - Colon indicates the start of the if block
        • If is_adult is True, the code inside will execute

Line 5:     print("You can vote!")
        • Four spaces of indentation (required in Python)
        • This code only runs if is_adult is True
        • Displays "You can vote!"

Line 6: else:
        • else - Alternative path if the condition is False
        • : - Colon indicates the start of the else block

Line 7:     print("You cannot vote yet.")
        • Four spaces of indentation
        • This code only runs if is_adult is False
        • Displays "You cannot vote yet."

================================================================================

SECTION 1.3: THE EQUALITY OPERATOR (==)
----------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The equality operator (==) is used to determine if two values are equal. 
It returns True if the values are equal, and False if they are not equal.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The equality operator uses two equal signs (==) to compare two values. It's 
important to note that this is different from the assignment operator (=), 
which assigns a value to a variable.

SYNTAX
------
  value1 == value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 equals value2
• False if value1 does not equal value2

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses two equal signs (==), not one (=)
• One equal sign (=) is for assignment, two (==) is for comparison
• Compares the actual values, not the variable names
• Works with numbers, strings, and other data types
• Case-sensitive when comparing strings

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of the equality operator like a balance scale:
• You place two items on the scale
• If they weigh the same, the scale balances (True)
• If they weigh differently, the scale tips (False)

EXAMPLE 1: COMPARING NUMBERS
------------------------------
  # Assign a value to variable a
  a = 6
  
  # Compare a with 7 using equality operator
  result1 = a == 7
  print("Is a equal to 7?", result1)  # Output: Is a equal to 7? False
  
  # Compare a with 6 using equality operator
  result2 = a == 6
  print("Is a equal to 6?", result2)  # Output: Is a equal to 6? True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Assign a value to variable a
        • Comment explaining the purpose

Line 2: a = 6
        • Creates variable 'a' and assigns the integer 6 to it
        • The single = is the assignment operator

Line 3: (blank line for readability)

Line 4: # Compare a with 7 using equality operator
        • Comment explaining the comparison

Line 5: result1 = a == 7
        • result1 - Variable to store the comparison result
        • = - Assignment operator (assigns the result to result1)
        • a - Variable containing 6
        • == - Equality operator (compares two values)
        • 7 - The value we're comparing against
        • Python evaluates: "Is the value in 'a' (which is 6) equal to 7?"
        • Answer: No, 6 is not equal to 7, so the result is False
        • False is stored in result1

Line 6: print("Is a equal to 7?", result1)
        • print() - Function to display output
        • "Is a equal to 7?" - String literal (text to display)
        • , - Separates multiple items to print
        • result1 - The variable containing False
        • Output: Is a equal to 7? False

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: # Compare a with 6 using equality operator
        • Comment for the second comparison

Line 9: result2 = a == 6
        • result2 - Variable to store the second comparison result
        • a == 6 - Comparison: "Is the value in 'a' (which is 6) equal to 6?"
        • Answer: Yes, 6 equals 6, so the result is True
        • True is stored in result2

Line 10: print("Is a equal to 6?", result2)
         • Displays the question and the result
         • Output: Is a equal to 6? True

WHAT HAPPENS STEP-BY-STEP:
--------------------------
For result1 = a == 7:
1. Python looks at variable 'a' and finds it contains 6
2. Python compares 6 with 7 using ==
3. Python asks: "Is 6 equal to 7?" → No
4. Python returns False
5. False is stored in result1

For result2 = a == 6:
1. Python looks at variable 'a' and finds it contains 6
2. Python compares 6 with 6 using ==
3. Python asks: "Is 6 equal to 6?" → Yes
4. Python returns True
5. True is stored in result2

EXAMPLE 2: COMPARING FLOATS
----------------------------
  # Assign a float value
  price = 19.99
  
  # Compare with different values
  result1 = price == 20.00
  print("Is price equal to 20.00?", result1)  # Output: False
  
  result2 = price == 19.99
  print("Is price equal to 19.99?", result2)  # Output: True
  
  # Be careful with floating-point precision
  result3 = 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
  print("Is 0.1 + 0.2 equal to 0.3?", result3)  # Output: False (surprising!)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Assign a float value
        • Comment explaining we're working with decimal numbers

Line 2: price = 19.99
        • price - Variable name
        • 19.99 - Float (decimal number)
        • Stores 19.99 in price

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Compare with different values
        • Comment

Line 5: result1 = price == 20.00
        • Compares 19.99 with 20.00
        • Since 19.99 ≠ 20.00, result is False

Line 6: print("Is price equal to 20.00?", result1)
        • Output: Is price equal to 20.00? False

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: result2 = price == 19.99
        • Compares 19.99 with 19.99
        • Since they're equal, result is True

Line 9: print("Is price equal to 19.99?", result2)
        • Output: Is price equal to 19.99? True

Line 10: (blank line)

Line 11: # Be careful with floating-point precision
         • Important comment about a common pitfall

Line 12: result3 = 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
         • 0.1 + 0.2 - Calculates 0.1 + 0.2 first
         • The result is approximately 0.30000000000000004 (due to floating-point representation)
         • == 0.3 - Compares this with 0.3
         • They're not exactly equal, so result is False
         • This is a common issue with floating-point arithmetic

Line 13: print("Is 0.1 + 0.2 equal to 0.3?", result3)
         • Output: Is 0.1 + 0.2 equal to 0.3? False

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT FLOATING-POINT COMPARISONS
-----------------------------------------------
When comparing floats, be aware that floating-point arithmetic can have 
precision issues. Instead of using ==, consider using a small tolerance:

  # Better way to compare floats
  tolerance = 0.0001
  result = abs(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3) < tolerance
  print(result)  # Output: True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Better way to compare floats
        • Comment explaining a better approach

Line 2: tolerance = 0.0001
        • tolerance - A small acceptable difference
        • 0.0001 - The maximum difference we'll accept as "equal"

Line 3: result = abs(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3) < tolerance
        • abs() - Absolute value function (removes negative sign)
        • 0.1 + 0.2 - Calculates 0.30000000000000004
        • - 0.3 - Subtracts 0.3, giving a very small difference
        • abs() - Makes sure the difference is positive
        • < tolerance - Checks if the difference is less than our tolerance
        • If the difference is tiny, we consider them equal
        • Result: True (the difference is very small)

Line 4: print(result)
        • Output: True

EXAMPLE 3: COMPARING STRINGS
-----------------------------
  # Comparing strings
  band1 = "AC/DC"
  band2 = "Michael Jackson"
  band3 = "AC/DC"
  
  # Compare different strings
  result1 = band1 == band2
  print("Is band1 equal to band2?", result1)  # Output: False
  
  # Compare same strings
  result2 = band1 == band3
  print("Is band1 equal to band3?", result2)  # Output: True
  
  # String comparison is case-sensitive
  result3 = "Python" == "python"
  print("Is 'Python' equal to 'python'?", result3)  # Output: False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Comparing strings
        • Comment explaining we're comparing text

Line 2: band1 = "AC/DC"
        • band1 - Variable name
        • "AC/DC" - String literal (text in quotes)
        • Stores the text "AC/DC" in band1

Line 3: band2 = "Michael Jackson"
        • Stores "Michael Jackson" in band2

Line 4: band3 = "AC/DC"
        • Stores "AC/DC" in band3 (same as band1)

Line 5: (blank line)

Line 6: # Compare different strings
        • Comment

Line 7: result1 = band1 == band2
        • Compares "AC/DC" with "Michael Jackson"
        • They are different strings, so result is False

Line 8: print("Is band1 equal to band2?", result1)
        • Output: Is band1 equal to band2? False

Line 9: (blank line)

Line 10: # Compare same strings
         • Comment

Line 11: result2 = band1 == band3
         • Compares "AC/DC" with "AC/DC"
         • They are identical strings, so result is True

Line 12: print("Is band1 equal to band3?", result2)
         • Output: Is band1 equal to band3? True

Line 13: (blank line)

Line 14: # String comparison is case-sensitive
         • Important comment about case sensitivity

Line 15: result3 = "Python" == "python"
         • Compares "Python" (capital P) with "python" (lowercase p)
         • String comparison is case-sensitive, so they're different
         • Result: False

Line 16: print("Is 'Python' equal to 'python'?", result3)
         • Output: Is 'Python' equal to 'python'? False

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-------------------------
1. Using = instead of ==
   Wrong:  if a = 5:  # This assigns 5 to a, doesn't compare!
   Right:  if a == 5:  # This compares a with 5

2. Comparing different data types
   result = "5" == 5  # False (string "5" vs integer 5)
   result = 5 == 5.0  # True (Python converts int to float for comparison)

3. Forgetting case sensitivity with strings
   result = "Hello" == "hello"  # False (different cases)

SECTION 1.4: THE INEQUALITY OPERATOR (!=)
------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The inequality operator (!=) checks if two values are NOT equal. It returns 
True if the values are different, and False if they are the same.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The inequality operator uses an exclamation mark followed by an equal sign 
(!=) to determine if two values are different. It's the opposite of the 
equality operator (==).

SYNTAX
------
  value1 != value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 does NOT equal value2 (they are different)
• False if value1 equals value2 (they are the same)

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses exclamation mark and equal sign (!=)
• Returns True when values are different
• Returns False when values are the same
• Opposite of the equality operator (==)
• Works with numbers, strings, and other data types
• Case-sensitive when comparing strings

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of the inequality operator like checking if two items are different:
• "Are these two apples different?" → True if they're different, False if identical
• "Is this password different from the old one?" → True if changed, False if same

EXAMPLE 1: COMPARING NUMBERS WITH INEQUALITY
---------------------------------------------
  # Assign a value
  i = 2
  
  # Check if i is not equal to 6
  result = i != 6
  print("Is i not equal to 6?", result)  # Output: True
  
  # Check if i is not equal to 2
  result2 = i != 2
  print("Is i not equal to 2?", result2)  # Output: False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Assign a value
        • Comment

Line 2: i = 2
        • Creates variable 'i' and assigns 2 to it

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check if i is not equal to 6

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN == AND !=
------------------------------
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator (==):

  value1 == value2  # True if equal, False if not equal
  value1 != value2  # True if not equal, False if equal

They always give opposite results:

  a = 5
  b = 5
  c = 10
  
  print(a == b)  # True (they are equal)
  print(a != b)  # False (they are NOT different)
  
  print(a == c)  # False (they are not equal)
  print(a != c)  # True (they ARE different)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: a = 5
        • Stores 5 in variable a

Line 2: b = 5
        • Stores 5 in variable b (same value as a)

SECTION 1.5: THE GREATER THAN OPERATOR (>)
-------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The greater than operator (>) checks if the left operand is greater than the 
right operand. It returns True if the left value is larger, and False otherwise.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The greater than operator compares two values and determines if the first 
value is larger than the second value. It's commonly used to compare numbers 
and establish ordering relationships.

SYNTAX
------
  value1 > value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 is greater than value2
• False if value1 is less than or equal to value2

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses a single greater than sign (>)
• Compares the left operand with the right operand
• Returns True only when left value is strictly greater
• Returns False if values are equal or left is smaller
• Works with numbers (integers and floats)
• Can be used with strings (lexicographic comparison)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of the greater than operator like comparing ages:
• "Is person A older than person B?" → True if A's age > B's age
• "Is $100 more than $50?" → True (100 > 50)
• "Is 3 o'clock later than 2 o'clock?" → True (3 > 2)

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC GREATER THAN COMPARISON
----------------------------------------
  # Assign a value to variable i
  i = 6
  
  # Check if i is greater than 5
  result = i > 5
  print("Is i greater than 5?", result)  # Output: True
  
  # Check if i is greater than 10
  result2 = i > 10
  print("Is i greater than 10?", result2)  # Output: False

Line 5: result = i > 5
        • result - Variable to store the comparison result
        • i - Variable containing 6
        • > - Greater than operator
        • 5 - Value we're comparing against
        • Python evaluates: "Is the value in 'i' (which is 6) greater than 5?"
        • Answer: Yes, 6 is greater than 5, so result is True
        • True is stored in result

Line 6: print("Is i greater than 5?", result)
        • Displays the question and result
        • Output: Is i greater than 5? True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: # Check if i is greater than 10
        • Comment

Line 9: result2 = i > 10
        • Compares 6 with 10 using >
        • "Is 6 greater than 10?" → No, 6 is less than 10
        • Result: False

Line 10: print("Is i greater than 10?", result2)
         • Output: Is i greater than 10? False

VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITH NUMBER LINE
--------------------------------------
When we check i > 5, we can visualize this on a number line:

  Numbers where i > 5 is False:  ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Numbers where i > 5 is True:  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

If i = 6:
• 6 is in the "True" region (6 is greater than 5)
• Result: True

If i = 3:
• 3 is in the "False" region (3 is not greater than 5)
• Result: False

If i = 5:
• 5 is exactly on the boundary
• Since > means strictly greater (not equal), 5 is NOT greater than 5
• Result: False

EXAMPLE 2: COMPARING FLOATS
----------------------------
  # Comparing decimal numbers
  price1 = 19.99
  price2 = 15.50
  
  # Check if price1 is greater than price2
  result = price1 > price2
  print("Is price1 greater than price2?", result)  # Output: True
  
  # Compare with equal values
  price3 = 19.99
  result2 = price1 > price3
  print("Is price1 greater than price3?", result2)  # Output: False

         • Compares 19.99 with 19.99
         • "Is 19.99 greater than 19.99?" → No, they're equal
         • Result: False

Line 12: print("Is price1 greater than price3?", result2)
         • Output: Is price1 greater than price3? False

EXAMPLE 3: COMPARING STRINGS (LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDER)
---------------------------------------------------
Strings can be compared using >, which compares them alphabetically 
(lexicographically):

  name1 = "Alice"
  name2 = "Bob"
  
  result = name1 > name2
  print("Is 'Alice' greater than 'Bob'?", result)  # Output: False
  
  # Explanation: 'A' comes before 'B' alphabetically
  result2 = "Zebra" > "Apple"
  print("Is 'Zebra' greater than 'Apple'?", result2)  # Output: True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: name1 = "Alice"
        • Stores "Alice" in name1

Line 2: name2 = "Bob"
        • Stores "Bob" in name2

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: result = name1 > name2
        • Compares "Alice" with "Bob" alphabetically
        • Python compares character by character
        • First character: 'A' vs 'B'
        • 'A' comes before 'B' in the alphabet
        • So "Alice" is NOT greater than "Bob"
        • Result: False

Line 5: print("Is 'Alice' greater than 'Bob'?", result)
        • Output: Is 'Alice' greater than 'Bob'? False

Line 6: (blank line)

Line 7: # Explanation: 'A' comes before 'B' alphabetically
        • Comment explaining the comparison logic

Line 8: result2 = "Zebra" > "Apple"
        • Compares "Zebra" with "Apple"
        • First character: 'Z' vs 'A'
        • 'Z' comes after 'A' in the alphabet
        • So "Zebra" IS greater than "Apple"
        • Result: True

Line 9: print("Is 'Zebra' greater than 'Apple'?", result2)
        • Output: Is 'Zebra' greater than 'Apple'? True

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT STRING COMPARISON
---------------------------------------
• String comparison is case-sensitive: 'A' < 'a' (uppercase comes before lowercase in ASCII)
• Comparison is done character by character from left to right
• If first characters are equal, it compares the next characters
• Shorter strings come before longer strings if they match up to that point

SECTION 1.6: THE LESS THAN OPERATOR (<)
-----------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The less than operator (<) checks if the left operand is less than the right 
operand. It returns True if the left value is smaller, and False otherwise.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The less than operator compares two values and determines if the first value 
is smaller than the second value. It's the opposite of the greater than 
operator (>).

SYNTAX
------
  value1 < value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 is less than value2
• False if value1 is greater than or equal to value2

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses a single less than sign (<)
• Compares the left operand with the right operand
• Returns True only when left value is strictly smaller
• Returns False if values are equal or left is larger
• Works with numbers (integers and floats)
• Can be used with strings (lexicographic comparison)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of the less than operator like comparing prices:
• "Is $10 less than $20?" → True (10 < 20)
• "Is person A younger than person B?" → True if A's age < B's age
• "Is 2 o'clock earlier than 3 o'clock?" → True (2 < 3)

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC LESS THAN COMPARISON
--------------------------------------
  # Assign a value to variable i
  i = 2
  
  # Check if i is less than 6
  result = i < 6
  print("Is i less than 6?", result)  # Output: True

        • Result: False

Line 10: print("Is i less than 1?", result2)
         • Output: Is i less than 1? False

VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITH NUMBER LINE
--------------------------------------
When we check i < 6, we can visualize this on a number line:

  Numbers where i < 6 is True:  ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Numbers where i < 6 is False:  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

If i = 2:
• 2 is in the "True" region (2 is less than 6)
• Result: True

If i = 8:
• 8 is in the "False" region (8 is not less than 6)
• Result: False

If i = 6:
• 6 is exactly on the boundary
• Since < means strictly less (not equal), 6 is NOT less than 6
• Result: False

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN > AND <
----------------------------
The less than operator (<) is the opposite of the greater than operator (>):

  a = 5
  b = 10
  
  print(a < b)   # True (5 is less than 10)
  print(a > b)   # False (5 is not greater than 10)

SECTION 1.7: THE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO OPERATOR (>=)
---------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) checks if the left operand is 
greater than OR equal to the right operand. It returns True if the left 
value is larger or equal, and False if the left value is smaller.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The greater than or equal to operator is a combination of two conditions:
1. Greater than (>)
2. Equal to (==)

It returns True if EITHER condition is true (the value is greater OR equal).

SYNTAX
------
  value1 >= value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 is greater than value2 OR value1 equals value2
• False if value1 is less than value2

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses >= (greater than sign followed by equal sign)
• Returns True if left value is greater OR equal
• Returns False only if left value is strictly less
• Includes the boundary case (equality)
• Works with numbers (integers and floats)
• Can be used with strings (lexicographic comparison)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of >= like age requirements:
• "Are you 18 or older?" → True if age >= 18
• "Do you have $10 or more?" → True if money >= 10
• Includes both "greater than" and "equal to" cases

         • Output: Is i (2) greater than or equal to 5? False

VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITH NUMBER LINE
--------------------------------------
When we check i >= 5, we can visualize this on a number line:

  Numbers where i >= 5 is False:  ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  Numbers where i >= 5 is True:  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

Notice that 5 is included in the "True" region (because of the "equal to" part).

If i = 5:
• 5 is in the "True" region (5 equals 5, so >= is true)
• Result: True

If i = 6:
• 6 is in the "True" region (6 is greater than 5)
• Result: True

If i = 2:
• 2 is in the "False" region (2 is less than 5)
• Result: False

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN > AND >=
---------------------------
The key difference is whether equality is included:

  value = 5
  
  print(value > 5)   # False (5 is NOT greater than 5)
  print(value >= 5)  # True (5 IS equal to 5, so >= is true)
  
  value = 6
  print(value > 5)   # True (6 is greater than 5)

Line 6: print("Can enter concert?", can_enter)
        • Output: Can enter concert? True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: age = 17
        • Reassigns age to 17

Line 9: can_enter = age >= 18
        • Compares age (17) with 18 using >=
        • "Is 17 greater than OR equal to 18?" → No
        • Result: False
        • Stores False in can_enter

Line 10: print("Can enter concert?", can_enter)
         • Output: Can enter concert? False

SECTION 1.8: THE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO OPERATOR (<=)
------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
The less than or equal to operator (<=) checks if the left operand is less 
than OR equal to the right operand. It returns True if the left value is 
smaller or equal, and False if the left value is larger.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
The less than or equal to operator is a combination of two conditions:
1. Less than (<)
2. Equal to (==)

It returns True if EITHER condition is true (the value is less OR equal).

SYNTAX
------
  value1 <= value2

This compares value1 with value2 and returns:
• True if value1 is less than value2 OR value1 equals value2
• False if value1 is greater than value2

KEY POINTS
----------
• Uses <= (less than sign followed by equal sign)
• Returns True if left value is less OR equal
• Returns False only if left value is strictly greater
• Includes the boundary case (equality)
• Works with numbers (integers and floats)
• Can be used with strings (lexicographic comparison)

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
------------------
Think of <= like maximum limits:
• "Is your age 65 or less?" → True if age <= 65
• "Do you have $100 or less?" → True if money <= 100
• Includes both "less than" and "equal to" cases

EXAMPLE 1: BASIC LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO COMPARISON
---------------------------------------------------
  # Assign a value to variable i
  i = 5
  
  # Check if i is less than or equal to 5
  result1 = i <= 5
  print("Is i less than or equal to 5?", result1)  # Output: True
  
  # Check with a value less than 5
  i = 2
  result2 = i <= 5
  print("Is i (2) less than or equal to 5?", result2)  # Output: True
  
  # Check with a value greater than 5
  i = 6
  result3 = i <= 5
  print("Is i (6) less than or equal to 5?", result3)  # Output: False

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Assign a value to variable i
        • Comment

Line 2: i = 5
        • Creates variable 'i' and assigns 5 to it

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # Check if i is less than or equal to 5
        • Comment

Line 5: result1 = i <= 5
        • result1 - Variable to store the result
        • i - Variable containing 5
        • <= - Less than or equal to operator
        • 5 - Value we're comparing against
        • Python evaluates: "Is the value in 'i' (which is 5) less than 
          OR equal to 5?"
        • Since 5 equals 5, the "equal to" part is true
        • Result: True

Line 6: print("Is i less than or equal to 5?", result1)
        • Output: Is i less than or equal to 5? True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: # Check with a value less than 5
        • Comment

Line 9: i = 2
        • Reassigns i to 2

Line 10: result2 = i <= 5
         • Compares 2 with 5 using <=
         • "Is 2 less than OR equal to 5?" → Yes, 2 is less than 5
         • Result: True

Line 11: print("Is i (2) less than or equal to 5?", result2)
         • Output: Is i (2) less than or equal to 5? True

Line 12: (blank line)

Line 13: # Check with a value greater than 5
         • Comment

Line 14: i = 6
         • Reassigns i to 6

Line 15: result3 = i <= 5
         • Compares 6 with 5 using <=
         • "Is 6 less than OR equal to 5?" → No, 6 is greater than 5
         • Result: False

Line 16: print("Is i (6) less than or equal to 5?", result3)
         • Output: Is i (6) less than or equal to 5? False

VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITH NUMBER LINE
--------------------------------------
When we check i <= 5, we can visualize this on a number line:

  Numbers where i <= 5 is True:  ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Numbers where i <= 5 is False:  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

Notice that 5 is included in the "True" region (because of the "equal to" part).

If i = 5:
• 5 is in the "True" region (5 equals 5, so <= is true)
• Result: True

If i = 2:
• 2 is in the "True" region (2 is less than 5)
• Result: True

If i = 6:
• 6 is in the "False" region (6 is greater than 5)
• Result: False

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN < AND <=
---------------------------
The key difference is whether equality is included:

  value = 5
  
  print(value < 5)   # False (5 is NOT less than 5)
  print(value <= 5)  # True (5 IS equal to 5, so <= is true)
  
  value = 4
  print(value < 5)   # True (4 is less than 5)
  print(value <= 5)  # True (4 is less than 5)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: value = 5
        • Stores 5 in value

Line 2: (blank line)

Line 3: print(value < 5)
        • Compares 5 with 5 using <
        • "Is 5 less than 5?" → No (strictly less, not equal)
        • Output: False

Line 4: print(value <= 5)
        • Compares 5 with 5 using <=
        • "Is 5 less than OR equal to 5?" → Yes (equal part is true)
        • Output: True

Line 5: (blank line)

Line 6: value = 4
        • Reassigns value to 4

Line 7: print(value < 5)
        • Compares 4 with 5 using <
        • "Is 4 less than 5?" → Yes
        • Output: True

Line 8: print(value <= 5)
        • Compares 4 with 5 using <=
        • "Is 4 less than OR equal to 5?" → Yes (less part is true)
        • Output: True

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN >= AND <=
------------------------------
These operators are related but serve different purposes:

  value = 5
  
  print(value >= 5)  # True (5 is greater than or equal to 5)
  print(value <= 5)  # True (5 is less than or equal to 5)
  
  # If both are true, the values must be equal
  if value >= 5 and value <= 5:
      print("Value is exactly 5")

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: value = 5
        • Stores 5 in value

Line 2: (blank line)

Line 3: print(value >= 5)
        • Checks if 5 >= 5 → True

Line 4: print(value <= 5)
        • Checks if 5 <= 5 → True

Line 5: (blank line)

Line 6: # If both are true, the values must be equal
        • Comment explaining the logic

Line 7: if value >= 5 and value <= 5:
        • Checks if value is both >= 5 AND <= 5
        • This can only be true if value equals exactly 5
        • Both conditions are True, so the code inside executes

Line 8:     print("Value is exactly 5")
         • Output: Value is exactly 5

================================================================================

SECTION 1.9: COMPARING DIFFERENT DATA TYPES
--------------------------------------------

DEFINITION
----------
Python allows comparison operations between different data types, but the 
results depend on the types being compared. Some comparisons are valid, 
while others may raise errors or produce unexpected results.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
--------------------
Python's comparison operators work differently depending on the data types 
involved. Understanding these differences is crucial for writing correct code.

COMPARING NUMBERS (INTEGERS AND FLOATS)
---------------------------------------
Python can compare integers and floats directly:

  # Comparing int with int
  result1 = 5 == 5
  print(result1)  # Output: True
  
  # Comparing int with float
  result2 = 5 == 5.0
  print(result2)  # Output: True (Python converts int to float)
  
  # Comparing float with float
  result3 = 5.0 == 5.0
  print(result3)  # Output: True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Comparing int with int
        • Comment

Line 2: result1 = 5 == 5
        • Compares two integers
        • 5 equals 5, so result is True

Line 3: print(result1)
        • Output: True

Line 4: (blank line)

Line 5: # Comparing int with float
        • Comment

Line 6: result2 = 5 == 5.0
        • Compares integer 5 with float 5.0
        • Python automatically converts the int to float for comparison
        • 5.0 equals 5.0, so result is True

Line 7: print(result2)
        • Output: True

Line 8: (blank line)

Line 9: # Comparing float with float
        • Comment

Line 10: result3 = 5.0 == 5.0
         • Compares two floats
         • 5.0 equals 5.0, so result is True

Line 11: print(result3)
         • Output: True

COMPARING STRINGS
-----------------
Strings are compared character by character (lexicographically):

  # String comparison
  result1 = "apple" < "banana"
  print(result1)  # Output: True ('a' comes before 'b')
  
  result2 = "Apple" < "apple"
  print(result2)  # Output: True (uppercase comes before lowercase in ASCII)
  
  result3 = "10" < "2"
  print(result3)  # Output: True (string comparison, not numeric!)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # String comparison
        • Comment

Line 2: result1 = "apple" < "banana"
        • Compares strings lexicographically
        • First character: 'a' vs 'b'
        • 'a' comes before 'b', so "apple" < "banana" is True

Line 3: print(result1)
        • Output: True

Line 4: (blank line)

Line 5: result2 = "Apple" < "apple"
        • Compares "Apple" (capital A) with "apple" (lowercase a)
        • In ASCII/Unicode, uppercase letters come before lowercase
        • 'A' (ASCII 65) < 'a' (ASCII 97), so result is True

Line 6: print(result2)
        • Output: True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: result3 = "10" < "2"
        • IMPORTANT: These are strings, not numbers!
        • String comparison: compares character by character
        • First character: '1' vs '2'
        • '1' (ASCII 49) < '2' (ASCII 50), so result is True
        • This is NOT the same as comparing numbers 10 and 2!

Line 9: print(result3)
        • Output: True

COMPARING STRINGS WITH NUMBERS
------------------------------
Comparing strings with numbers will raise a TypeError:

  # This will cause an error
  # result = "5" > 3  # TypeError: '>' not supported between 'str' and 'int'
  
  # To compare, convert to same type first
  result = int("5") > 3
  print(result)  # Output: True

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # This will cause an error
        • Comment warning about the error

Line 2: # result = "5" > 3  # TypeError: '>' not supported between 'str' and 'int'
        • This line is commented out to prevent the error
        • If uncommented, Python would raise a TypeError
        • Python cannot directly compare strings with numbers

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: # To compare, convert to same type first
        • Comment explaining the solution

Line 5: result = int("5") > 3
        • int("5") - Converts the string "5" to integer 5
        • Now we're comparing int 5 with int 3
        • 5 > 3, so result is True

Line 6: print(result)
        • Output: True

COMPARING BOOLEAN VALUES
------------------------
Boolean values can be compared, and they have numeric equivalents:
• True is equivalent to 1
• False is equivalent to 0

  # Boolean comparison
  result1 = True == 1
  print(result1)  # Output: True
  
  result2 = False == 0
  print(result2)  # Output: True
  
  result3 = True > False
  print(result3)  # Output: True (1 > 0)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: # Boolean comparison
        • Comment

Line 2: result1 = True == 1
        • Compares Boolean True with integer 1
        • In Python, True is equivalent to 1
        • Result: True

Line 3: print(result1)
        • Output: True

Line 4: (blank line)

Line 5: result2 = False == 0
        • Compares Boolean False with integer 0
        • In Python, False is equivalent to 0
        • Result: True

Line 6: print(result2)
        • Output: True

Line 7: (blank line)

Line 8: result3 = True > False
        • Compares True (1) with False (0)
        • 1 > 0, so result is True

Line 9: print(result3)
        • Output: True

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
1. Always compare values of compatible types
2. Convert types explicitly when needed: int("5") > 3
3. Be careful with string vs numeric comparisons
4. Use type() function to check types before comparing
5. For numeric strings, convert to numbers before comparing

SECTION 1.10: SUMMARY OF COMPARISON OPERATORS
----------------------------------------------

QUICK REFERENCE TABLE
---------------------
Operator    Name                        Returns True When
--------    ----                        -----------------
==          Equality                    Left equals right
!=          Inequality                  Left does not equal right
>           Greater than                Left is greater than right
<           Less than                   Left is less than right
>=          Greater than or equal to    Left is greater than or equal to right
<=          Less than or equal to        Left is less than or equal to right

EXAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT VALUES
------------------------------
  a = 5
  b = 10
  
  print(a == b)   # False (5 is not equal to 10)
  print(a != b)   # True (5 is not equal to 10)
  print(a > b)    # False (5 is not greater than 10)
  print(a < b)    # True (5 is less than 10)
  print(a >= b)   # False (5 is not greater than or equal to 10)
  print(a <= b)   # True (5 is less than or equal to 10)

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
Line 1: a = 5
        • Stores 5 in variable a

Line 2: b = 10
        • Stores 10 in variable b

Line 3: (blank line)

Line 4: print(a == b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using ==
        • 5 ≠ 10, so result is False
        • Output: False

Line 5: print(a != b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using !=
        • 5 ≠ 10, so result is True
        • Output: True

Line 6: print(a > b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using >
        • 5 is not greater than 10, so result is False
        • Output: False

Line 7: print(a < b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using <
        • 5 is less than 10, so result is True
        • Output: True

Line 8: print(a >= b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using >=
        • 5 is not greater than or equal to 10, so result is False
        • Output: False

Line 9: print(a <= b)
        • Compares 5 with 10 using <=
        • 5 is less than or equal to 10, so result is True
        • Output: True

COMMON PATTERNS AND USE CASES
------------------------------
1. Equality check: if user_input == "yes":
2. Range checking: if 0 <= score <= 100:
3. Age verification: if age >= 18:
4. String validation: if password != "":
5. Boundary conditions: if value > 0 and value < 10:

KEY TAKEAWAYS
-------------
• All comparison operators return Boolean values (True or False)
• Comparison operators are used in conditional statements
• Be careful with data types when comparing
• String comparison is lexicographic (alphabetical)
• Numeric comparison works with integers and floats
• Always use == for equality, not = (which is assignment)
