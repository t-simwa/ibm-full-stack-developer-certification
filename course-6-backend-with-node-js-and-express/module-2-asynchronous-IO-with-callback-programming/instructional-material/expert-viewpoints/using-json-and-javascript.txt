Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Using JSON and
JavaScript. In this video, we will hear from several
application development professionals discussing situations where knowing JSON and JavaScript has helped
them and how they think these methods can benefit new cloud application developers. Familiarity with JavaScript and JSON is more
or less a requirement for web developers. If you're not working with the front end at
all, you might be able to get away without touching any JavaScript, but JSON is the de
facto standard for data serialization. You will want to learn how to (3)use JSON
so that you can consume APIs written by other people and also, make your own APIs return JSON so other people can easily use them. Another place you'll see JSON a lot is where
you have to specify something in a way the computer can easily understand. So you'll probably first see that when specifying
requirements for a Node.js project, for instance, but you might see it again when specifying deployments
for platform as a service offerings or Kubernetes workloads. JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is built
into JavaScript, right? So when you're working with objects in JavaScript,
you're essentially working with JSON. That being said, with RESTful web services,
a common format of communication or data is also JSON. So as Node.js developers and as JavaScript
developers, you cannot escape from JSON. It's actually a very friendly format to work
with. JSON is one of the things, one of those things
if you're a JavaScript developer, if you're a Node.js developer, you need to understand
and work with JSON objects. So, the sooner you pick it up, the better. JSON is one of the dominant formats to encode
objects in a string. And JSON is a native data type in JavaScript. So serialization converts the JSON object
into a byte string and deserialization converts the byte string back to the JSON object. One great benefit of being comfortable with
JSON is that the request and response objects in cloud,
REST APIs are often in JSON, at least when you're working at the curl level or the shell
script level. Another benefit of knowing JavaScript and
JSON is working with JSON Oriented document databases. Writing in JavaScript and using JSON helps
me all the time, because JavaScript is the language of the
Internet. So you see it in a lot of applications. And being able to just add some code to an
existing project or write some JavaScript from scratch is really useful. It's like speaking, a language that's very
popular. And JSON is used by many of the modern languages,
including Python and Node.js. So I use Python every single day, because
it's a really useful way to structure your data and pass it back and forth. And, you know, that's the way you get a response
from most APIs.
