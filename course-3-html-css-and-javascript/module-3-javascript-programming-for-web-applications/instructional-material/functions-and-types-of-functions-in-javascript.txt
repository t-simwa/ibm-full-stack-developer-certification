Welcome to introduction to functions and types
of functions. After watching this video, you will be able to define the concepts of
functions in JavaScript, differentiate between non parameterized and
parameterized functions, and identify the
two main ways of defining functions and the
various types of functions. In JavaScript, a function
is a reusable block of code that can be defined and executed as many
times as needed. Functions are a fundamental part of the language and are used to encapsulate and organize code into manageable, reusable units. They are essential for building complex applications as they help improve code structure, readability, and
maintainability. Let's delve into more details
by introducing functions in JavaScript The first step
is declaring a function. You can declare a function using the function keyword
followed by a name, enclosed parentheses, and the functions code
enclosed in curly braces. Here's a basic example. After declaring a function, you can call it by using its name, followed
by parentheses. When you call a function, it executes the code
within its block. In JavaScript, functions can be categorized into two main types based on their parameters, inputs, non-parameterized
functions and parameterized functions. Let's explore each in detail. Non-parameterized
functions do not require any parameters
to operate. They can perform
their tasks without receiving any specific
input values. Non-parameterized functions
are often used for tasks that rely solely on their internal
logic or external factors. Parameterized functions except
one or more parameters, also called arguments that provide input data for the
function to work with. You define these parameters in the function's declaration, and when you call the function, you pass specific values
for those parameters. Both parameterized and
non-parameterized functions have their uses in JavaScript, depending on the specific
requirements of your code. Parameterized functions
are versatile because they can adapt to
different input values, making them more flexible. While non parameterized
functions are simpler and more suitable for tasks that don't need external data. Now let's learn about
parameters and arguments. Parameters are
variables you define in the function declaration
to accept input values. Arguments are the
actual values you pass to a function
when calling it. In the previous example, A and B are parameters, and when we call add 3, 4 by passing values, these values are the arguments that get passed to the function. There are two ways of writing
a function in JavaScript, function declaration,
function expression. Let's explore each
in more detail. Function declaration is the traditional way
to define a function. It is similar to how we define a function in other
programming languages. We start by declaring it
using the keyword function, then we write the function
name and the parameters. Function expression
is another way to define a function
in JavaScript. Here we define a function using a variable and store the
returned value in that variable. Finally, let's explore
the various types of functions in JavaScript. They are, named function, immediately invoked
function expression, IIFE, arrow function
and anonymous function. Let's learn about
each in detail. Named functions
have specific names that can be called
by their names. They are typically
declared using the function keyword and can be defined at any
point in your code. In the given example, the
name of the function is add. Named function expressions
are beneficial for debugging because they display the function's name
in the call stack, aiding and identifying and
tracking bugs in your code. Immediately invoked function
expression, or IIFE, is a function in
JavaScript that's defined and executed
immediately after its creation. It's often employed
to encapsulate variables and code
within a private scope, helping to prevent global
scope contamination and variable conflicts. The arrow function is
a more concise way to write functions
introduced in ES6. They are often used for
short, simple functions. Anonymous functions
are without a name. These are often
used as arguments for other functions or
assigned to variables. For example, you can create anonymous functions using
the arrow function syntax. In this video, you
learned that functions are code blocks that enhance code organization
and readability. JavaScript functions
enhance code structure and maintainability for
complex applications. Functions are defined with
a function keyword, a name, parameters, and code
in curly braces, and can be invoked using
the function name. There are two categories
of functions, non-parameterized
functions that operate without specific input, and parameterized
functions that accept input parameters defined in
the functions declaration. There are two ways
to write functions. Function declaration is
the traditional way, and function expression
uses variables. The types of functions
include named function, immediately invoked
function expression, IIFE, arrow function,
and anonymous function.
