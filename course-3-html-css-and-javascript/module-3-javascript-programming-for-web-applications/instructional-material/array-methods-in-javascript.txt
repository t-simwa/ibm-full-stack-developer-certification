Welcome to Array Methods. After watching this video, you will be able to describe the various JavaScript
array methods and explain how to utilize array methods to transform and manipulate data
within arrays. Arrays in JavaScript, come with a rich set
of built-in functions, often called array methods, that simplify common
array operations. These methods provide
a convenient way to perform various
operations on arrays, from iterating through their
elements to filtering, transforming, aggregating, and searching for specific data. The common array
methods used to handle various tasks are forEach, map, filter, reduce, and find. Let's explore these methods and understand how they work,
and when to use them. The forEach method
iterates through an array, and applies a provided
function to each element. It's commonly used when
you want to perform a specific action
for each element, without creating a new array. Imagine you have an
array of user objects and want to send a welcome
email to each user. This JavaScript code sends welcome emails to
users by iterating through an array of
user objects and using a function.
Here's a breakdown. This is a function that logs
a welcome email message to console.log for a
given email address. Const users
created an array called users containing name and email. Users.forEach iterates
through the array. For each user, it calls the sendWelcomeEmail function
with the user's email. This defines an arrow
function that takes the current user
object as a parameter. This function logs
a welcome message with the provided
email to the console. As a result, you'll see
messages in the console indicating that welcome
emails have been sent to each user's
email address. The map method creates
a new array by applying a provided function to each element in the
original array. It's perfect for
transforming data without modifying
the original array. Suppose you have an
array of products, and want to extract their
prices into a new array. The map method constructs and logs messages for each product, displaying the product name and price in the specified format. This code dynamically generates and logs messages
for each product, displaying its name and price. Let's go through the
code step by step. Const products declare
an array with objects, each representing a product with name and price properties. The map method iterates
through the products array, and executes the provided arrow function for each element, saving the element in
the product variable. Console.log logs messages to the console within
the map function, displaying product
information. This template string replaces placeholders with actual values. The filter method
creates a new array containing elements that
pass a specified condition. It's useful for extracting
specific data from an array. You have an array of
products and want to filter out products as
per the price range. Let's go through the
code step by step. Const products declare a
constant variable named product. This takes three parameters. Return products.filter, filters the product array based on the specified criteria. Const minPrice and const
maxPrice set price threshold. Const filteredProducts,
store the filtered products. This calls the function with the specified parameters to
obtain the filtered products. Filtered products.forEach iterates through the
filtered products, saving the element in
the product variable. Console.log prints a
message to the console. The code then
filters and displays the product names and prices within the specified
price range. The reduce method allows
you to reduce an array to a single value by applying
a function to each element. It's excellent for
aggregating data. You have an array
of order prices, and want to calculate
the total order value. Let's break down the
code step by step. Const orderPrices, stores
the order price data. Const totalOrderValue, stores
the total order value. OrderPrices.reduce, uses the reduce
method to iterate through the array and
accumulate the values. This is an arrow
function that calculates the total by adding each price
to the accumulated total. After iteration, the
reduce method returns the final total order value stored in the total
order value variable. Console.log prints the total
order value to the console. As a result, the code calculates
the total order value by adding up all the prices
in the order prices array, and displays it in the console. In this case, the total
order value is 160. The find method returns
the first element in an array that satisfies
a specified condition. It's useful for searching
for specific data. You have an array
of employees and want to find an employee
with a specific ID. Let's go through the
code step by step. Const employees, store employee data with
various properties. Employees.find, searches for an employee based
on the specific condition. This checks if the
ID property of each employee object, e = 2. Console.log displays the result, \n creates line breaks
for better formatting. Dollar sign interpolates and
inserts employee objects. For example, ${employee.name} inserts the employee's name. As a result, the code will check whether an employee
has an Eid equal to 2, and display the details using console.log and
template literals. In this video, you learned that the forEach method
iterates through an array executing a provided
function for each element, often for side effects. The map method generates a new array by applying a
function to each element, which is useful for
data transformation. The filter method produces
a new array with elements, meeting a specified condition, effectively filtering
the original array. The reduce method
consolidates array values into a single result using
a provided function, commonly for calculating totals. The find method locates the first array element
meeting a condition, returning that element, or undefined if there
are no matches.
