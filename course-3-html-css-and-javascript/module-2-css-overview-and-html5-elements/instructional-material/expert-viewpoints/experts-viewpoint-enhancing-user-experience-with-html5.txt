Welcome to Insiders Viewpoints, Enhancing the User Experience with HTML5. In this video, we will listen to several web development professionals discuss using HTML5 features that enhance the user experience. So, what are some of the exciting features in HTML5, and how do they enhance the user experience? Can you include some advice and best practices for the new learner? HTML5 introduced several new input fields for web forms to enhance user experience. Developers can use these input fields to display customized virtual keyboard layouts and build-in data validation. For example, using an email input field, the user is shown a custom keyboard containing AtTheRate or a .com for handy auto-filling of the field. HTML5 has native video support and can be directly built into the supporting browsers, which allow faster, high-quality videos to be distributed. This also has a positive impact on the SEO of a webpage. HTML also supports geolocation, which is of tremendous importance when developing location-based applications or services.
