## 🎯 The Universal Process

Every programming problem follows this process:

```
1. UNDERSTAND → 2. BREAK DOWN → 3. PLAN → 4. CODE → 5. TEST → 6. DEBUG → 7. REFINE
```

### Quick Reference

**1. UNDERSTAND**
- Read the problem carefully
- Identify inputs, outputs, and process
- Create examples
- Identify edge cases

**2. BREAK DOWN**
- Split into smaller pieces
- Identify sub-problems
- Think about data transformations

**3. PLAN**
- Write pseudocode
- Choose data structures
- Identify algorithms/patterns

**4. CODE**
- Write step by step
- Test as you go
- One piece at a time

**5. TEST**
- Test with examples
- Test edge cases
- Verify output

**6. DEBUG**
- Find the problem
- Fix it systematically
- Test again

**7. REFINE**
- Clean up code
- Improve readability
- Optimize if needed
