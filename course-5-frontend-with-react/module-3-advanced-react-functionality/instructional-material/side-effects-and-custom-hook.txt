Welcome to a video on Site Effects Management and Custom Hook. After watching this video, you will be able to Define the role of UseEffect and SiteEffects in React. Describe how UseEffect and SiteEffects works in React. Describe the various dependencies in UseEffect. Describe a custom hook in React. UseEffect is a React hook that allows you to perform SiteEffects and functional components. A SiteEffect refers to any operation that you need to execute as soon as the page loads, without calling those operations slash functionalities separately, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, manipulating the DOM, or setting timers. SiteEffects are actions that occur asynchronously, and affect the application's state or the UI. Here's a simple example to understand UseEffect and the SiteEffects in React. Suppose we have a component that fetches a list of food items from an API and displays them. In this code example, the components are as follows. State Management with UseState. The component utilizes the UseState hook to manage the state within a functional component. Specifically, it declares a state variable named foods using UseState, initializing it with an empty array. This variable will later hold the data fetched from the API. Performing SiteEffects with UseEffect. The UseEffect hook is employed to execute SiteEffects in functional components. In this component, UseEffect is utilized to fetch data from an external API when the component mounts. Data Fetching. Inside the UseEffect hook, a fetch request is made to the specified API endpoint, as shown. The fetch function returns a promise that resolves to the response from the server. Upon receiving the response, response.json parses the response body as JSON. The parsed JSON data is then available in the next then block, where it is logged to the console for debugging purposes and subsequently passed to setFoods to update the food state variable with the fetched data. If an error occurs during the fetch operation, it is caught in the catch block and an error message is logged to the console. Rendering the Fetched Data. In the JSX returned by the component, a list, ul, of food items is rendered. The map method is used to iterate over the foods array and generate a list item, li, for each food item. For each food item, details such as name, description, price, category, ingredients, and an image are displayed. The image is rendered using the image tag with the URL obtained from the image underscore URL property of each food item. Component Export. Finally, the SideEffect component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application. In React's useEffect hook, dependencies refer to variables or values which are used to determine when useEffect should run. Dependencies are specified as an array argument to the useEffect function. The following are some dependencies. When you provide an empty dependency array, the effect runs only once when the component will load for the first time. It does not depend on any specific variable or state changes. This behavior is used to execute tasks only once at the time of loading. For example, in the code, the page will only load once at the loading of this page. When you provide values in the dependency array, the effect runs whenever any of these values change. For example, the count value as shown in the code. If any of the dependencies have changed since the last render, React will rerun the effect. In the code, the effect runs only when the count state changes, ensuring that the useEffect hook executes whenever count is updated. Therefore, the count variable is included in the dependency array. If you omit the dependency array entirely, the effect will run after every render, including the initial render and subsequent updates. This means that the effect will execute both after the initial render and after every rerender of the component, regardless of whether you change any values. This behavior with no dependency will cause the effect to run after every render. You can use a custom hook in React to create reusable logic. Custom hooks allow you to abstract complex logic that you can easily reuse across different components in your application. Let us understand this with an example. You have two components, ToggleButton and UseToggle. Let's go through the ToggleButton code. The ToggleButton component imports and utilizes a custom hook named UseToggle, which uses the logic for toggling between true and false states. Within the ToggleButton component, the UseToggle hook is used to manage the state of a button. The hook returns two values, IsToggled, representing the current state, either true or false, and Toggle, a function that toggles the state between true and false when invoked. In the JSX, a button is rendered with a text content of on when the state is true and off when the state is false. Upon clicking the button, the toggle function is triggered, updating the state accordingly. This setup provides a simple and reusable way to create toggle functionality within React components. The reusable code of the UseToggle custom hook is as shown. It manages the true and false state of the ToggleButton. The output before clicking the ToggleButton will be as shown. After clicking the ToggleButton, the output will be as shown. This toggle will be performed as long as the user clicks on the button. In this video, you learned that UseEffect is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects are actions that occur asynchronously, affecting the application state or UI. In React's UseEffect hook, dependencies refer to variables or values which are used to determine when UseEffect should run. Custom hooks allow you to abstract complex logic that you can easily reuse across different components in your application.
