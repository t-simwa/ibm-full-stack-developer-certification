Welcome to State Management
in Function Components. After watching this video, you will be able to explain the concept
of state management, explain the value of state management when
developing function components, describe the syntax
of the useState hook, manipulate a component's state
using the useState hook. In React, you will use states to manage data that can change over time
within a component. A component's state refers to the condition of that
component at a specific time. The state of an object
holds information that influences its behavior and renders it based on
that information. Before the
introduction of hooks, React could not manage the
state of function components. Now, function components have local state management
capabilities. You will see a demonstration of the useState hook
function in this video. Hooks enable you to reuse code logic across
components without changing component hierarchy or introducing
unnecessary nesting. They also make it
easier to share and compose functionality across
different components. Let's look at a commonly
used hook named useState. The useState hook
allows you to add state management functionalities
to function components. It returns a
stateful value using one variable and a function to update the value
of that variable. You can see the syntax here. You call the useState function and pass in the initial
state as a parameter. Assign the return value to
a const array variable. The array has two values: the stateName and the stateName prefixed with the keyword, set. Let's take a closer look
at each of these tokens. This syntax uses array destructuring for
the const variable. Array destructuring
allows you to extract values from an array and assign them to
individual variables. Using this feature to assign variables with an
array simplifies your code when accessing array elements by avoiding
repetitive indexing. In this case, it extracts two values from the
array returned by useState and assigns
them to variables named stateName and setStateName,
respectively. The stateName variable stores
the current state value. This variable represents the current state
of the component. You can access it and
update it as needed. You can use the
setStateName function provided by the useState hook
to update the state value. When you call setStateName, React will re-render
the component with the updated state value, triggering any
necessary UI updates. You pass the initial state value into the useState
function as a parameter. This value initializes
the stateName variable when first rendering
the component. Next, you will see this syntax demonstrated
with an example. Let's look at the
code used to develop a UI similar to
what is shown here. Before the user
selects the button, the interface displays
"The name is John." After the button selection, the interface will display
"The name is John Doe." You can use this component,
StateManagement, to manage and display
the component's state with the useState hook. The component imports the
necessary dependencies from the React package, including React and
the useState hook. Inside the component function, you declare a state
variable name function, setName, to update the name state variable
using the useState hook. The code sets the
initial value of the nameState variable to John. The useState hook
returns an array with two elements: the
current state value of the name variable
and a function, setName, to update
that state value. You use array destructuring syntax to assign these
elements to variables. The component
returns JSX elements encapsulated within a fragment. It includes an H1
element displaying the title "State Management
using useState," and a paragraph element
showing the current value of the name state variable
using JSX interpolation. Next, we take a closer look
at the purpose of set state. Say you initialize
the name value to John as in the
previous example, and now you want to update
the user's name from John to John Doe when the
user selects a button. In this code, we named
the object setName. You should use this
set state function for this. This code adds a
button element to the JSX returned
by the component. This button has an onClick
event handler attached to it. When the user clicks the button, it calls the
updatedName function, which in turn calls the
setName function embedded in the updatedName function
with the argument, John Doe. The setName function updates the name state
variable to John Doe. As a result, after
pressing the button, the component re-renders and displays the name "John Doe." After the button click,
it becomes disabled with the help of the buttonClicked
useState variable. Let's examine another
example where you define a component
named ToggleMessage. You could use this component
to show or hide a message. Inside the component,
use the useState hook to declare a state variable named isVisible and
initialize it to true. This variable represents the visibility state
of the message. Define a function
toggleVisibility that toggles the value of isVisible when
the user clicks a button. It negates the current
value of isVisible, thus toggling between
true and false. The JSX code renders a div element containing
an H2 heading, a button, and a paragraph. The button has an
onClick event handler that calls the toggleVisibility
function when clicked. The button text changes dynamically based on
the value of isVisible. If isVisible is true, the button text displays
"Hide message." Otherwise, it displays
"Show message." The paragraph
conditionally renders based on the value of isVisible. If isVisible is true, the UI shows the paragraph
"This is a hidden message." When the value is false,
it remains hidden. In this video, you
learned state management allows you to manage
data that can change over time
within a component. The useState hook enables function components to manage the component's state locally. You can use this syntax when
using the useState hook. Call the useState function and pass in the initial
state as a parameter. Assign the return value to a const array variable
using a destructured array. The array has two values: the stateName and the stateName prefixed with the word set. You should use the useState
hook when you need to make a component dynamic
and interactive.
