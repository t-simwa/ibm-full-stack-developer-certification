Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Working with
3rd party Node.js Extensions. In this video, several application
development professionals will discuss which 3rd party Node.js extensions they commonly
use and how these extensions could often benefit application developers. One of the NPM Node.js packages that I've
used the most is the serverless framework, because that allows you to deploy serverless
microservices in the cloud very easily without writing a lot of the resource and infrastructures
code yourself. There's a number of Node.JS extensions I use
all the time. For instance, I use Lodash, which is a great
package for dealing with collections and arrays, finding the right elements, sorting, so on
and so forth. It saves a lot of time. Axios is also very useful for dealing with
RESTful APIs. and submitting GETS, PUTS, POSTS, so on and so forth. Also in my Express applications there's a
ton of middlewares, especially middlewares dealing with authentication and JWT tokens. Those are all extremely useful and really
help accelerate any cloud developer creating services and other tools in the cloud. When working with Node.js, I'll give you two
of my favorite packages that I use on a daily basis. So first is making requests to web services. So my application more likely than not has
to request information from another web service. Now, this could be a web service that I've
written, or this could be a web service that somebody else has written. Regardless, I need to send a request out with
some input parameters, and then wait for the request to come back, or wait for the response
to come back and handle that response. Instead of writing all of this code myself,
I use a library like Axios that helps me create these requests with the right headers and
also provides me with callback functions and/or promises to be able to handle the responses
that come back. My second package would be when I'm working
with databases, I'll use NPM packages, more likely than not to talk to an external database,
regardless of if it's a relational database or a NoSQL database.
