[MUSIC] Welcome to a video about
the Redux toolkit. After watching this video, you will be
able define Redux Toolkit in the context of React, describe the Redux Toolkit
utilities used to streamline Redux tasks, describe the Redux Toolkit architecture, describe the relationship
between a store and a slice. In the context of React, Redux Toolkit (RTK)
is an official package the Redux team provides to simplify Redux
development and make it more efficient. It includes utilities that help
streamline common Redux tasks, reduce boilerplate code,
and simplify development. Redux Toolkit includes utilities
to streamline Redux tasks. It provides a configureStore function
that combines several pieces of Redux setup logic into a single function call. The function includes setting up the Redux
store with commonly used middleware such as Redux Thunk for
handling asynchronous actions and enabling the Redux Devtools Extension for
debugging. Redux Toolkit introduces the createSlice
function, which allows developers to define slice reducers that automatically
handle immutable updates to the state. The function makes it easier to write
reducer logic without having to worry about mutating the state directly. Redux Toolkit significantly reduces the
boilerplate code needed to set up Redux in an application. This reduction leads to cleaner, more
concise code and faster development time. Using Redux Toolkit can make your Redux
code base cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain, especially in larger applications
where managing state can be complex. To get started with the Redux
Toolkit in a React application, you can install it through npm or yarn. Also, ensure that React Redux is
installed on your application. The Redux Toolkit contains at least
one slice file and one store file. A slice in the Redux Toolkit represents
a piece of your application state and the logic to update it. Slices are typically defined using
the createSlice function provided by Redux Toolkit. It consists of a reducer,
action creators, and an initial state. A reducer is a function that
receives the current state and an action and
returns a new state based on that action. Action creators are functions that create
actions to be dispatched to the store. The initial state is the initial
value of the state slice. The Redux store is a single JavaScript
object that holds the complete state tree of your application. It is the source of truth for your data. In the Redux Toolkit, the store is created
using the configureStore function, which takes in an object with
reducer functions as its argument. The store allows access to the state
through the getState function, allows state updates
through dispatch(action), and registers listeners
through subscribe(listener). The relationship between a slice and
the store can be summarized as follows. Slices define individual parts
of your application state and the logic to update them. The store is where all these slices are
combined to form the complete state tree of your application. Each slice reducer is added to the Redux
store during its creation using the configureStore function. The store combines all the slice
reducers into a single reducer using combineReducers function. When actions are dispatched,
the store delegates them to the appropriate slice reducers
based on their corresponding slice. Let us understand the relationship between
slices and stores using an example. Suppose you have an e-commerce application
that depicts the increase in the product quantity in your cart, the total
bill amount, and the number of super coins you will earn on a purchase that
you can use in your next payment. In this application,
you will have the following components, App.jsx is the parent component, ProductQuantity.jsx will increment
the quantity of a product item, CartValue.jsx will
calculate the total amount, CounterSlice.jsx will
contain the reducer and any associated action creators
within a single file, Store.jsx will store the Redux state, Main.jsx is the entry point. ProductQuantity.jsx displays
a product's quantity and allows users to increase or decrease it. It imports use dispatch and use selector hooks from React Redux
to interact with the Redux store. useSelector is used to extract
the counter state from the Redux store. The component renders buttons to
increment or decrease the quantity. When these buttons are clicked,
the corresponding increment or decrement action from the CounterSlice is dispatched
to the Redux store using dispatch. CartValue.jsx component
determines the total bill amount and displays it based on the product
quantity saved in the Redux store. To get the counter information from
the Redux store, it uses useSelector. The final amount is calculated using the
number of items and a set price per unit. CounterSlice.jsx file defines
a Redux slice named counter. It initializes the counter state
to zero and defines two reducers, increment and decrement. When the increment or
decrement actions are dispatched, they update the counter state accordingly. Store.jsx file configures
the Redux store using configureStore from the Redux toolkit. It imports the counterReducer
from CounterSlice and sets it as the reducer for
the CounterSlice. The configureStore is then exported and
used in the application. The main.jsx component is
the entry point of the application. It wraps the app component
with the provider component from React Redux passing
the Redux store as a prop. In this video, you learned that in
the context of React, Redux Toolkit, or RTK, is an official package the Redux team provides to simplify Redux
development and make it more efficient. Redux Toolkit provides a configureStore
function that combines several pieces of Redux setup logic into
a single function call. Redux Toolkit introduces the createSlice
function, which allows developers to define "slice reducers" that automatically
handle immutable updates to the state. A slice in the Redux Toolkit represents
a piece of your application state and the logic to update it. The Redux store is a single JavaScript
object that holds the complete state tree of your application.
